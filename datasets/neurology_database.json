However, achieving this goal is highly challenging, specifically in neurology. Our contribution is a machine-learning based joint molecular subtyping of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), based on the genetic burden of 15 molecular mechanisms comprising 27 proteins (e.g. APOE) that have been described in both diseases. We demonstrate that our joint AD/PD clustering using a combination of sparse autoencoders and sparse non-negative matrix factorization is reproducible and can be associated with significant differences of AD and PD patient subgroups on a clinical, pathophysiological and molecular level. Hence, clusters are disease-associated. To our knowledge this work is the first demonstration of a mechanism based stratification in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, we thus see this work as an important step towards a molecular mechanism-based taxonomy of neurological disorders, which could help in developing better targeted therapies in the future by going beyond classical phenotype based disease definitions.",

The patient was a known case of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and on long-term immunosuppressants. He presented with a rapidly progressive, unilateral decline in visual acuity in the right eye. Dilated fundus examination showed a large whitish subretinal lesion. A working diagnosis of subretinal abscess was made. The appearance was highly suspicious for Nocardia abscess. On further direct questioning, it was noted that the patient had been experiencing low-grade fever and non-productive cough for 1 month. The patient was referred to infectious diseases for systemic work-up and a vitreous tap was done, along with intravitreal antibiotics. Blood culture and bronchoalveolar lavage both reported Nocardia species. Sensitivity-guided antibiotic therapy resulted in improved systemic condition and a quiet and comfortable right eye, but vision could not be saved due to late presentation.",

Acute neurological involvement is well described, but its long-term impact requires evaluation. One-hundred thirty-one patients, following an acute TTP event, with severe headache or neurological symptoms had a cerebral MRI. Fifty-six percent had abnormal imaging, more commonly in patients with neurological symptoms than headaches only (80% vs. 18%, P < 0·0001). In remission, 27% (n = 35) reported persistent cognitive symptoms: specifically, impaired memory (66%), difficulty concentrating (26%), and word-finding difficulties not secondary to an acute stroke (26%). Sixty-five percent also reported depression and 55% reported anxiety, regardless of presenting neurology. The frontal lobe was disproportionally affected in patients with marked intellectual impairment, seen in 67% of patients compared to 19% of patients without intellectual impairment (P = 0·002). The primary MRI finding in these patients was hyperintense white matter lesions. An abnormal MRI was associated with a lower median verbal IQ (85 vs. 99, P = 0·02) and performance IQ (83 vs. 100, P = 0·02). In conclusion, neurological symptoms are frequently associated with an abnormal cerebral MRI scan, and white matter frontal lobe lesions are particularly significant, leading to marked intellectual impairment. Anxiety and depression were evident in over half of patients, regardless of neurological involvement at presentation.",

Effective non-invasive imaging device for bedside monitoring of stroke is critically needed in clinically. This study developed a lightweight (350 kg) and low-footprint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system for brain imaging. Static magnetic field was built using an H-typed permanent magnet, which has 50.9 mT magnetic field strength (corresponding to 2.167 MHz proton Larmor frequency). Biplanar gradient coils were designed using the target field method based on dipole equivalent. Radio-frequency coils were optimized by particle swarm optimization. The 2 MHz MRI system was deployed in the Department of Neurology of hospital to test its performance in stroke imaging detection. Gradient recall echo and fast spin echo sequences were utilized to acquire T1- and T2-weighted MR images, respectively. Brain images of a healthy volunteer, a patient with hemorrhagic stroke, a patient of ischemic stroke, and a patient with ischemic stroke and images from 17-day long-term monitoring of hemorrhagic stroke were obtained with a 1.5 mm * 2.0 mm spatial resolution in plane, and a 10 mm thickness.",

Most children with CP survive well into adulthood. Adults with CP experience increased risk of age-related chronic conditions such as arthritis, stroke, cardiorespiratory and mental health conditions in addition to the ongoing disabilities experienced from childhood. Therefore, adults with CP often require extensive health services. However, health service use among adults with CP has not been well documented. This mixed method review aims to identify, appraise and synthesise quantitative and qualitative literature examining health service use among adults with CP.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The mixed method systematic review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. A systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library from inception to March 2020 will be conducted. Quantitative observational studies, qualitative studies and mixed method studies examining health service use among adults with CP (?18 years) will be included. Outcomes of interest are the proportion of adults using health services frequency of use and experiences of health services from the perspectives of adults with CP, caregivers and health service providers. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-texts, extract data and assess the quality of included studies using JBI instruments. Where possible a pooled analysis and aggregation of findings will be performed for quantitative and qualitative data, respectively, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)/GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) employed. Quantitative and qualitative findings will be integrated using a triangulation approach at the synthesis stage. A narrative synthesis will be carried out where this is not possible.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this review. The findings will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal and conferences.PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020155 380.",

In such cases, the families suffer from severe crisis and anxiety due to the unexpected incidence of the disease and unawareness of the associated consequences.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of informational support on the level of anxiety in family caregivers of hemiplegic stroke patients.METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was performed on 78 family caregivers of hemiplegic stroke patients admitted to the Neurology Department of Farshchian Hospital in Hamadan, Iran, over 8 months. The subjects were selected through convenience sampling method and divided into two groups of intervention (n = 40) and control (n = 38). Intervention started from the third day of hospitalization and continued until the eleventh day. During this period, information about the ward, equipment, patient status, and care procedure at home, was provided for the intervention group individually and in groups. On the other hand, the control group only received the routine care. Anxiety level of caregivers was measured through the Spielberger scale both before and after the intervention. Data analysis was performed in SPSS software (version 16).RESULTS: Based on the results, both groups were similar in terms of demographic variables (P > 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the mean level of state and trait anxiety before the intervention (P > 0.05). However, after intervention, the mean level of state and trait anxiety of the intervention group showed a significant reduction in comparison to that of the control group (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings, it can be concluded that informational support is effective in reducing the state and trait anxiety in family caregivers of stroke patients. Therefore, it is suggested that nurses consider informational support as an important nursing intervention during hospitalization.",

Preliminary reports suggest that the disease may present in diverse ways, including with neurological symptoms, but few published reports in the literature describe seizures in patients with COVID-19.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize the risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes of seizures in patients with COVID-19.METHODS: This is a retrospective case series. Cases were identified through a review of admissions and consultations to the neurology and neurocritical care services between April 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020.SETTING: The study setting was in a tertiary care, safety-net hospital in Boston, MA.PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting with seizures and COVID-19 during the study period were included in the study.RESULTS: Seven patients met inclusion criteria (5 females, 71%). Patients ranged in age from 37 to 88 years (median: 75 years). Three patients had a prior history of well-controlled epilepsy (43%), while 4 patients had new-onset seizures, including 2 patients with prior history of remote stroke. Three patients had no preceding symptoms of COVID-19 prior to presentation (57%), and in all cases, seizures were the symptom that prompted presentation to the emergency department, regardless of prior symptoms of COVID-19.CONCLUSIONS: Provoking factors for seizures in patients with COVID-19 may include metabolic factors, systemic illness, and possibly direct effects of the virus. In endemic areas with community spread of COVID-19, clinicians should be vigilant for the infection in patients who present with seizures, which may precede respiratory symptoms or prompt presentation to medical care. Early testing, isolation, and contact tracking of these patients can prevent further transmission of the virus.",

However, there is considerable variability in therapy intensity among studies and notable lack of information on optimal intervention dosing. This makes it difficult for clinicians to use evidence to inform practice. Many studies use the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) to assess functional progress in children with CP. The purpose of this systematic review will be to identify the GMFM-66 change score reported in published studies, with outcomes based on intervention intensity. Whether the type of PT intervention, child's age, and Gross Motor Function Classification System level influence the GMFM-66 scores will be also assessed.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This systematic review protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist. In March 2018, nine databases (PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and REHABDATA) were searched for controlled clinical trials and single-subject design studies of PT interventions of any kind and intensity that used the GMFM-66 as an outcome measure for children with CP, age up to 18 years. Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts and arrived at consensus on paper selection for a full-text review. The same process was used for a full-text article screening based on further detailed inclusion criteria, with a final selection made for those suitable for data extraction. Prior to commencement of data extraction, all searches will be updated, and new results re-screened.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will involve a systematic review of published articles and no primary data collection. Therefore, no ethical approval will be necessary. Results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed publication and presented at scientific conferences.PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020147669.",

We reviewed the records of patients who had a post-hormonal laboratory assessment of their adrenal function; either a low dose ACTH test or a random morning cortisol level and looked for laboratory or clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency.RESULTS: Between the years 2007 and 2018, 45 children were diagnosed with IS at our Pediatric Neurology Unit, 20 patients were treated with ACTH, of them 14 children met the inclusion criteria and had a post-treatment laboratory assessment of adrenal function by low dose ACTH test or morning cortisol level. Five children had a normal low dose ACTH test, two had normal morning cortisol level, five were not conclusive, and two had subnormal levels of cortisol. None of the children showed clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency.CONCLUSION: Our study adds to the limited literature on this topic and in contrast to previous publications suggests that adrenal suppression should not occur after ACTH treatment.",

Depression status among children with epilepsy was evaluated by the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC). Information on sociodemographic characteristics, co-morbid diseases and family conditions were collected as independent variables. Variables found in univariate analysis to affect depression were used in a multiple linear regression model on factors related to depression among children with epilepsy.A total of 124 patients participated in the study, with a response rate of 93.9% (124/132). In this sample, 60.5% (75/124) of patients were male and the mean age of patients was 11.17 ± 2.29 years. The mean score on the DSRSC was 9.65 ± 6.45 and 16.9% (21/124) of children with epilepsy were considered to have depression. According to the multiple linear regression analysis, the DSRSC scores showed a significant correlation with comorbidities (B = 0.178; standard error (SE) = 1.123; P = .043), attitude towards seizures (B = -0.180; SE = 1.171; P = .039) and adverse reaction to medications (B = 0.233; SE = 1.797; P = .008).There is relatively high prevalence of depression in children with epilepsy in western China. More health education is needed to reduce the rate of depression in children with epilepsy, particularly for those patients with comorbidities, negative attitudes towards seizures and adverse reactions to medications.",

Little is known about what parents of children with genetic disorders think about genetic therapies, or about their knowledge of how genetic-based therapy might treat their child's symptoms. Forty-two parents of children with Angelman syndrome (AS) and 27 parents of a mixed etiology comparison group completed an online survey reporting on their perceptions of, and priorities for, genetic therapy. Almost all parents of children with AS (95%) and the comparison group (89%) agreed that treatments aiming to reduce symptoms associated with their child's syndrome were positive. However, significantly more parents of children with AS (95%) than the comparison group (56%) felt that genetic treatment trials aiming to \"cure\" their child should be a research priority. AS parent priorities for the focus of clinical trials were neurology/seizures, communication skills, and motor skills/mobility. For the comparison group, the priorities were IQ, immune response, and expressive speech. Parents of both groups did not want treatments to change their child's personality or their happiness. Global assumptions cannot be made about targets for therapy between syndromes, about parental understanding of genetics, or about research evidence across syndromes. This study highlights the need for true family and patient engagement in all stages of the research design and treatment evaluation.",

However, 'prescriptive' techniques, such as Functional Neurology (FN), Sacro-Occipital Technique, and Applied Kinesiology are more concerned with the 'technical' diagnosis than the condition and its symptoms and, thus, seem to provide easy solutions.DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES: In a voluntary anonymous questionnaire survey carried out late 2017, we explored interest in 'prescriptive' techniques, particularly FN, among French chiropractic students in grades 3-6, and the possible link with chiropractic conservatism. We investigated their: i) attitudes to the use of 'prescriptive' techniques, ii) awareness of FN, and iii) attitudes to FN. Further, if their attitudes to some conservative chiropractic concepts influenced their clinical approach on iv) some 'prescriptive' chiropractic techniques and v) attitudes to FN.METHOD: Data reported in tables illustrated the prevalence of the use of 'prescriptive' techniques, awareness of FN, and positive attitude to FN (i.e. interest in and acceptance of). Students were given a FN score based on five questions on their interest in and acceptance of FN (0 to 5), dichotomized into two groups: 'not positive attitude' (0 to 1) and 'positive attitude' (2 to 5). Chiropractic conservatism was graded from 1 to 4. Associations were tested between conservatism groups and i) interest in 'prescriptive' techniques and ii) FN attitudes groups.RESULTS: The response rate was 67% (N = 359), of which 90% were positive toward 'prescriptive' techniques. Only 10% had never heard about FN and in the 6th year all had heard about it. Only a minority, unrelated to the year of study, approved of the two examples given of FN concepts. Nevertheless, a majority were positive towards FN, more so in the higher grades. Students with the most conservative beliefs were 17 times more likely to want to use 'prescriptive' techniques and 11 times more likely to have a higher FN score.CONCLUSION: Although not taught in the curriculum, these students were attracted to 'prescriptive' techniques including FN, particularly in the higher grades. Curiously, despite this interest they do not generally agree with some key concepts within FN.",

      "abstractText": "Introduction: Neurological diseases can be due to direct diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) or be a bystander syndrome of systemic diseases. Treatment options depend on the cause. Toxic, metabolic and nutritional, and immune-mediated consequences of clinically occult neoplasms produce a spectrum of neurological diseases, recognition of which has therapeutic and prognostic importance.Patients and Methods: Children, as well as adults who presented to the authors in the last 5 years with neurological diseases and later their diseases could be diagnosed or attributed to neoplasms which were occult, were included for the study.Observation: 28 patients were seen by the authors in the last 5 years with neurological manifestation and hidden tumor. Maximum incidence was in the age of above 60 years followed by the age group of 21-40 years. The commonest neurological presentation was muscle and nerve in adults and seizure in children.Discussion: Short duration, rapid progression, severe weight loss, and poor response to treatment given for nontumor associated neurological syndrome are the red flags which point to the diagnosis.Conclusion: Seizures and psychosis formed the commonest features in children, muscle and nerve in adults. Short duration, rapid progression, and resistance to treatment are the markers for possible underlying neoplasm.",

Although widely recognized, the association of these factors on clinical outcomes, resource utilization and productivity is not well understood.METHODS: All patients presenting to a military referral center for migraines are assessed for presence of traumatic brain injury, Headache Impact Score (HIT-6) and Patient Depression Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Based on screening, patients are offered referral to mental health and a multidisciplinary headache education course.RESULTS: 237 patients were seen for headache or migraine. 180 patients had severely disabling headaches. These patients accounted for 146 emergency room visits over the course of one year. Of headache patients, 65% met criteria for depression and 15% of patients had severe depression. Only 37% of these patients carried a formal diagnosis of depression and 38% had been seen by mental health. Lost productivity and duty limitations were significantly associated with severity of depression. In service members screening positively for mild, moderate or severe depression, duty restrictions had been placed on 8.3%, 32.5% and 53.8%, respectively. Only 3.8% of patients who did not screen for depression had similar duty limitations. A history of mTBI strongly correlated with comorbid depression. Lost productivity and duty limitations were not impacted by other headache characteristics or HIT-6 scores.CONCLUSIONS: This quality improvement project identified a practice gap for treatment of comorbid depression in patients presenting to Neurology for headache. Depression strongly correlated with productivity loss, highlighting a possible target for the economic burden of headache.",

We examined the effects of a neurite growth-enhancing anti-Nogo A antibody therapy following 3 routes of administration-intrathecal (i.t.), intravenous (i.v.), and subcutaneous (s.c.)-after large photothrombotic strokes in adult rats. Intrathecal treatment of full-length IgG anti-Nogo A antibodies enhanced recovery of the grasping function, but intravenous or subcutaneous administration had no detectable effect in spite of large amounts of antibodies in the peripheral circulation. Thus, in contrast to intravenous and subcutaneous delivery, intrathecal administration is an effective and reliable way to target CNS antigens. Our data reveal that antibody delivery to the CNS is far from trivial. While intrathecal application is feasible and guarantees defined antibody doses in the effective range for a biological function, the identification and establishment of easier routes of administration remains an important task to facilitate antibody-based future therapies of CNS disorders.",

Stress fractures could be seen in risc groups such as metabolic diseases/medications causing poor bone quality and exposing repetitive microtrauma. Anti-epileptic drug (AED) use is related with poor bone quality and increased fracture risc. Although carbamazepine-induced stress fracture is a well-known entity and there are case reports in other bones such as the femoral neck, bilateral calcaneal insufficiency fractures is an extraordinary location. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting an insufficiency fracture involving calcaneus in the relevant literature. Due to the rarity of both conditions, we decided to present and discuss this patient. When patients receiving AED treatment present with heel pain without previous plantar fasciitis history or traumatic event, insufficiency fractures should be kept in mind. This case highlights the importance of screening adverse effect of CBZ on bone metabolism in patients with long CBZ use. We report here a 41-year-old lady suffering from bilateral heel pain without trauma history. Her complaining did not respond to analgesics and stretching exercises of plantar fascia. In her past medical history she reported ongoing carbamazepine (CBZ) use over 8 years for trigeminal neuralgia. She had had low bone mineral density; defined as osteopenia. Both calcaneus MRI revealed bilateral stress fractures of calcaneum. She had been advised immobilization for 6 weeks, vitamin D and calcium supplements. CBZ has been stopped by neurology specialist and she had undergone microvascular decompression surgery for intractable pain of trigeminal neuralgia. She is doing well with full recovery from heel pain and trigeminal neuralgia at the end of one year. CBZ use causes poor bone quality through vitamin D metabolism. Heel pain without traumatic event, objective findings of plantar fasciitis and calcaneal spur syndrome in an CBZ using patient insufficiency fracture of calcaneus should be remembered and evaluated rigorously.",

A clinical coordinating center, data coordinating center, and 25 sites were competitively chosen. Common infrastructure was developed to accelerate timelines for clinical trials, including central institutional review board (a first for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke), master clinical trial agreements, the use of common data elements, and experienced research sites and coordination centers. During the first 7 years, the network exceeded the goal of conducting 5 to 7 studies, with 9 funded. High interest was evident by receipt of 148 initial applications for potential studies in various neurologic disorders. Across the first 8 studies (the ninth study was funded at end of initial funding period), the central institutional review board approved the initial protocol in a mean (SD) of 59 (21) days, and additional sites were added a mean (SD) of 22 (18) days after submission. The median time from central institutional review board approval to first site activation was 47.5 days (mean, 102.1; range, 1-282) and from first site activation to first participant consent was 27 days (mean, 37.5; range, 0-96). The median time for database readiness was 3.5 months (mean, 4.0; range, 0-8) from funding receipt. In the 4 completed studies, enrollment met or exceeded expectations with 96% overall data accuracy across all sites. Nine peer-reviewed manuscripts were published, and 22 oral presentations or posters and 9 invited presentations were given at regional, national, and international meetings.Conclusions and Relevance: NeuroNEXT initiated 8 studies, successfully enrolled participants at or ahead of schedule, collected high-quality data, published primary results in high-impact journals, and provided mentorship, expert statistical, and trial management support to several new investigators. Partnerships were successfully created between government, academia, industry, foundations, and patient advocacy groups. Clinical trial consortia can efficiently and successfully address a range of important neurologic research and therapeutic questions.",

We identified 1299 MS cases from the NHF data and 952,434 age and geographically matched controls. We estimated the prevalence of depression, sleep disorders, epilepsy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atherosclerosis, lung infections, thyroid disease, discopathy, and urinary tract infections in the MS population versus matched controls.RESULTS: In all, 815 cases of MS (67.6% women and 32.4% men) were registered with the MS center. According to the patients' medical records (with ICD 10 coding), the most common comorbidities were hypertension (4.3%) and thyroid diseases (3.3%). In addition, in standardized medical histories comorbidities were reported by MS patients: depression/depressed mood in 37.6% of patients (67% of whom had sought treatment), pain in 69.6% patients, urinary incontinence in 39.2% patients (44.9% of whom were treated), memory-related problems and fatigue in 39.2% and 70.8% patients, respectively. In the local NHF data, the most common comorbidities were hypertension (8%), diseases that cause back pain [ICD 10:M50-54 (4.3%),G54-55 (3%), M47-48 (5.4%)], urinary tract infection (3.5%), depression (2.4%), hyperlipidemia (2%), and diabetes (2%). All comorbidities except depression and sleep disorders were more common in the matched controls than in the MS population. Diabetes and hyperlipidemia in the MS population were more common in men than women. Most patients (89%) were not treated with disease-modifying therapies.CONCLUSION: The most common comorbidity in the MS population is hypertension. The MS population has an increased prevalence of depression versus the matched controls. MS patients-especially men and older individuals-are at increased risk of developing vascular diseases.",

However, its clinical utility is highly subject to variability in different protocols. New evidence has reported that preceding iTBS, with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) may stabilise and even boost the facilitatory effect of iTBS on the stimulated M1, via metaplasticity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of iTBS primed with cTBS (ie, priming iTBS), in addition to robot-assisted training (RAT), on the improvement of the hemiparetic upper limb functions of stroke patients and to explore potential sensorimotor neuroplasticity using electroencephalography (EEG).METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A three-arm, subjects and assessors-blinded, randomised controlled trial will be performed with patients with chronic stroke. An estimated sample of 36 patients will be needed based on the prior sample size calculation. All participants will be randomly allocated to receive 10 sessions of rTMS with different TBS protocols (cTBS+iTBS, sham cTBS+iTBS and sham cTBS+sham iTBS), three to five sessions per week, for 2-3 weeks. All participants will receive 60 min of RAT after each stimulation session. Primary outcomes will be assessed using Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores and Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using kinematic outcomes generated during RAT and EEG.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from The Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee, University Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (reference number: HSEARS20190718003). The results yielded from this study will be presented at international conferences and sent to a peer-review journal to be considered for publication.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04034069.",

We aim to characterize consultations, spoke behavior, and the relationship between spoke telestroke utilization (number of telestroke consults per year) and spoke alteplase treatment metrics in an academic telestroke network.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed prospectively collected data on all telestroke consults from 2003 to 2018. Trends in network performance and spoke characteristics were analyzed using generalized estimating equations and Kendall ôâ nonparametric tests as appropriate. Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models determined associations between telestroke utilization and treatment metrics. The network included 2 hubs and 43 spokes with 12 803 consults performed during the study period. Network growth overall was +1.8 spokes per year, and median duration of spoke participation was 7.9 years. The numbers of consults and alteplase-treated patients increased annually, even after adjusting for the number of spokes in the network (P<0.01 for both). Although times from last seen well to spoke emergency department arrival and to consult request increased, door-to-needle time, time from teleconsult request to callback, and time from teleconsult to alteplase administration all decreased (all P<0.01). With time, the network included more spokes without a Primary Stroke Center designation. In adjusted analyses, for every 10 telestroke consults requested by a spoke, the spoke door-to-needle decreased by 1.8 minutes (P=0.02), number of patients treated with alteplase was an additional 1.7 (P<0.01), and the percent of eligible patients treated with alteplase increased by 8% (P=0.03).CONCLUSIONS: Telestroke network size and utilization increased over time. Increased use of teleconsults was associated with increased and timely use of alteplase. Over time, the delivery of timely emergency care has improved significantly among emergency departments participating in this telestroke network. Replication of these findings in other networks is warranted.",

Direct medical costs were calculated using the standardised average expenses of medical procedures determined by the Spanish Ministry of Health.RESULTS: Data extraction claimed primary care records from 636 722 patients and secondary care records from 30 077 patients. Women represented 63% and 65% of all patients with headache in primary and secondary care respectively, with the exception of cluster headaches, a group with 60% of male patients. No large shifts were observed over time in patients' profile; contrarily, the number of cases per 10 000 patients attended in primary care increased 2-folds between 2011 and 2016 for migraine and 1.85-folds for other headaches. Migraine was the cause for 28% of primary care consultations and 50% of secondary care admissions, and it was responsible for the largest portion of healthcare costs in 2016, a total amount of € 7 302 718. The estimated annual direct medical cost of headache disorders was € 10 716 086.CONCLUSIONS: Migraine was responsible for half of the secondary care admissions linked to headache disorders. The raise detected in the number of cases registered in primary care is likely to impact the direct medical costs associated to these disorders causing an increase in the total burden they represent for the Spanish National Healthcare System.",

The study of neurochemical markers in this condition is relevant to the understanding of its pathophysiology. The assessment of the dopamine system is particularly relevant, as dopamine antagonists are the most used drugs in delirium.AIM: To analyze neurotransmission markers in patients with delirium, focusing in the dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid.METHODS: A case-control study was performed at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Mexico, including hospitalized patients in which lumbar puncture was obtained for diagnostic purposes. Cases were selected if they fulfilled DSM-5 criteria for delirium. Age-paired controls were patients in which delirium was ruled out, selected at the same clinical scenario, during the same period. Neurological and systemic diagnoses were registered. Delirium was assessed using the DRS-98-R instrument. The dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), was measured by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. Other neurotransmission markers were also measured (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, glutamate, aspartate, GABA, glycine, arginine, citrulline, nitrites, and nitrates). A logistic regression model was used to determine pathogenic factors associated with the presence of delirium.RESULTS: 68 neurological patients with delirium and 68 patients without delirium were included. Higher homovanillic acid levels in cerebrospinal fluid were significantly associated with delirium. This result was significant after a subanalysis in patients without exposure to antipsychotics. Male gender and autoimmune limbic encephalitis were also associated with the presence of delirium.CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized neurological patients, dopaminergic hyperactivity and autoimmune limbic encephalitis are pathogenic factors associated with the presence of delirium.",

It is the commonest physical disability in childhood that affects function and development. Neuro imaging is currently recommended as a standard evaluation in children with cerebral palsy. This hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted in Paediatric Neurology out-patient department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh from July 2015 to December 2015 to see the frequency and pattern of neuro-imaging findings in children with cerebral palsy. A total of 130 cases those who were attended and diagnosed as cerebral palsy based on history, clinical examination and neuro developmental assessment included in this study. All patients were sent to radiology & imaging department of same hospital for CT scan of brain. Among total 130 cerebral palsy patients male were more affected than female (88 boys and 42 girls) with male to female ratio 2.09: 1. Their ages ranged between 6-72 months with a mean age 25.6 months. The commonest age group was 6-24 months (46.9%). Common mode of delivery was normal vaginal delivery (62.3%) & Perinatal asphyxia (PNA) occurred in 66.9% cases. The commonest type of cerebral palsy was spastic form. Among them most cases were quadriplegic type, 64 cases (53.3%). Other cases were hemiplegic 27(20.7%) diplegic 13(10.0%). Total 84.7% had documented cerebral neuroimaging abnormalities; among them, diffuse cortical atrophy (46.9%), encephalomalacic change (19.9%), malformation (6.1%), and calcification (5.3%). CT scan was normal in 15.3% cases of cerebral palsy. The commonest co morbidity was speech delay (50%). Most of the patient with CP had abnormal CT scan finding though some patient had normal CT scan. Diffuse cerebral atrophy and encephalomalacic changes constitute frequent CT neuroimaging findings and commonly found in quadriplegic type of cerebral pulsy patients. Though diagnosis of cerebral palsy is essentially clinical, neuro imaging improves the understanding of the neuro-anatomical basis for function in CP. Etiology, type of CP and extent of motor impairments can easily be identified by the neuro imaging.",

The commonest TTR mutation is V30M (ATTRV30M) with patients usually living for about 10 years after disease onset. Liver transplantation (LT) until recently was considered the standard treatment.OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This study aims to assess the frequency of CNS complications in post-LT patients from the Cypriot cohort. Epidemiological data were collected for all genetically confirmed ATTRV30M neuropathy patients diagnosed at CING since 1992, and CNS-associated symptoms were assessed and evaluated by two neurology specialists.RESULTS: Out of the 48 transplanted patients, 10 (20.8%) presented with a CNS complication. All patients had ocular involvement, mainly glaucoma (7/10). Eight presented with transient focal neurological episodes (TFNEs), with expressive dysphasia being reported by four of them. The mean time of TFNE-emergence was 16.6 years after the LT. Three died from cerebral hemorrhage.CONCLUSIONS: CNS complications in post-LT ATTRV30M patients are not rare and usually manifest themselves at a time that surpasses the mean time the patients would have survived without a LT. CNS involvement is associated with increased mortality, due to cerebral hemorrhage.",

Methods: Patients admitted to the Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital from January to December 2017 were prospectively and continuously enrolled in this study. Clinical data were collected at admission and functional outcomes 90 days after ICH were assessed by using the modified RANKIN scale. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression models were constructed. Patients were divided into four groups according to the quartile of HbA1c values. The median value of HbA1c in each group was taken as the substitute value and P for trend was calculated. The logistic regression model was fitted by restricted cubic splines to investigate the association between HbA1c level and outcome of ICH. Results: A total of 345 patients with ICH were enrolled, including 214 with favorable outcomes and 131 with poor outcomes (99 severe disability cases and 32 deaths). The risk of poor 90 days outcomes was significantly associated with HbA1c level at admission indicated by multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the P for trend test was <0.001 (middle-level group vs. low-level group: OR=2.33, 95%CI: 1.07-5.07; high-level group vs. low-level group: OR=2.52, 95%CI: 1.12-5.64; extremely high-level group vs. low-level group: OR=6.80, 95%CI: 3.01-15.34). Results from the restricted cubic spline showed that there was a linear correlation between HbA1c level at admission and poor 90 days outcomes of ICH (÷(2)=14.81, P<0.001; non- linear test: P=0.118). Compared with patients with HbA1c level of 6.5%, the risk of poor outcomes in patients with HbA1c level of <6.5% decreased linearly with the decrease in HbA1c level at admission, and the risk in patients with HbA1c level >6.5% was higher but not significantly.

We sought to determine the effectiveness of a clinical decision support system on guideline-recommended medication use.METHODS: We randomized neurology providers, stratified by subspecialty, to a best practice alert (BPA) linked to a Smartset or a BPA alone when seeing patients with neuropathy. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with uncontrolled nerve pain prescribed a guideline-recommended medication. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess effectiveness.RESULTS: Seventy-five neurology providers (intervention 38, control 37) treated 2697 patients with neuropathy (intervention 1026, control 671). Providers did not acknowledge the BPA in 1928 (71.5%) visits. Only four of eight intervention arm neurologists who treated patients with uncontrolled nerve pain opened the Smartset. The intervention was not associated with guideline-recommended medication use (odds ratio 0.52, 0.18-1.48; intervention 52%, control 54.8%).DISCUSSION: Our intervention did not improve prescribing practices for painful neuropathy. Physicians typically ignored the BPAs/Smartset; therefore, future studies should mandate their use or employ alternate strategies.",

Subsequently, Devic became the eponym of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), which was then referred to as \"Devic's syndrome\", \"Devic's disease\" or \"Morbus Devic\". Thereby, the case became a historical index case of NMO. For many decades little attention was paid to NMO, which most authors considered a clinical variant of multiple sclerosis. However, the discovery of pathogenic antibodies to aquaporin-4 at the beginning of the 21st century revived interest in the syndrome, and AQP4-IgG-positive NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are now studied as prototypical autoimmune diseases. More recently, antibodies to full-length myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) have been detected in patients with ON as well as in patients with myelitis, some of whom exhibit a clinical phenotype very similar to that described by Devic. This raises the question of whether Devic's patient might have suffered from MOG encephalomyelitis rather than classic NMOSD. In this article, we summarise and discuss the available evidence for and against that hypothesis. We also discuss differential diagnoses and the question whether Devic's patient, who worked as a hatter and had initially been admitted for nervous hyperexcitability and tremor, might have suffered from co-existing erethism ('mad hatter disease'), which is caused by chronic occupational exposure to mercury.",

A 63-year-old patient with diabetes presented initially with abdominal pain, back pain, urinary retention and constipation. He subsequently developed fevers, radicular pain and new-onset weakness in the right leg. MRI confirmed a panspinal epidural abscess extending from C7 to L5, with group B Streptococcus (GBS) cultured on sampling. Due to the significant risks of surgery he was managed conservatively, initially with ceftriaxone, and subsequently in combination with linezolid. Repeat MRI 3 months after presentation revealed complete resolution of the abscess. This case illustrates how conservative management is a valid option for patients with this condition, and supports the use of synergistic linezolid in this scenario. It also highlights how some cases may not initially present with the classically described triad of fever, back pain and loss of neurological function.",

We offered it to all adult patients seen twice in an epilepsy clinic (January 2017-January 2018). The questionnaire was available on the web as well as a tablet provided at appointment check-in. We used the first completed questionnaire to explore the relationship between patient-reported care quality and measures of physical and mental health.RESULTS: A total of 610 unique patients (15% of the total encounters) completed a survey. Respondents were comparable to nonrespondents. Respondents reported gaps in care or opportunities for quality improvement in 48.4% (n = 295) of the encounters. Of patients who reported at least 1 seizure per month over the previous 3 months, 55.2% (n = 100) reported problems with adherence, 30.0% (n = 131) reported having problems believed to be adverse reactions to anticonvulsants, and 15.2% (n = 41) reported driving. In addition, respondents who reported either seizures over the recent 3 months, nonadherence to treatment due to cost, or anticonvulsant-associated adverse effects had consistently worse physical and mental health (all p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Systematic collection of epilepsy quality measures endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology can identify opportunities for quality improvement. Measures of epilepsy care quality predict outcomes that matter to patients.",

Diagnosing this entity is challenging due to the variability of clinical manifestations, late onset and relapse even after stopping the causative drug. It is potentially life-threatening; thus, it must be promptly recognised and the causative drug withdrawn. We describe a case of a 50-year-old man with an acute diffuse rash, fever and eosinophilia 4 weeks after having started lamotrigine. The suspected eliciting drug was suspended and systemic corticoid treatment was initiated (prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day). Symptoms relapsed under corticoid tapering with greater severity. The patient developed an exuberant rash associated with peripheral lymphadenopathies, marked eosinophilia and hepatic cytolysis. The diagnosis of DRESS syndrome to lamotrigine was made. Prednisolone dosage was increased to 1 mg/kg/day, and the subsequent taper was performed slowly over the course of 10 weeks. Full clinical remission was observed.",

We present a patient that developed severe rhabdomyolysis with tetra-affection and loss of gait after initiating the first cycle of Palbociclib concomitantly with Simvastatin 40 mg treatment.CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer developed tetraparesis and near fatal rhabdomyolysis after initiation of first cycle Palbociclib. For 10 years prior to this treatment, the patient had been treated with Simvastatin without myalgia or other neuromuscular complaints prior to the first cycle of Palbociclib. The patient was admitted at the neurology department, where Palbociclib and Simvastatin were discontinued. The patient was aggressively hydrated and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy with slowly remission and finally regaining independent gait function. Evaluation showed a negative myositis antibody work-up. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed edema in multiple foci, but skeletal muscle biopsy did not show necrosis. Post discharge genetic analysis showed single heterozygosity for nucleotide polymorphism rs4149056.CONCLUSION: We present a patient who developed severe rhabdomyolysis induced by a combination of Palbociclib and Simvastatin treatment. Rhabdomyolysis was most likely induced by toxic plasma concentrations of Simvastatin due to Palbociclibs inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme in combination with a decreased hepatic uptake of Simvastatin due to single nucleotide polymorphism rs4149056. The study underscores that combining Simvastatin and Palbociclib should be done cautiously and genetic testing of the rs4149056 SNP is warranted. If present, Simvastatin should be discontinued or replaced with a lesser myopathic statin in regard to patients risk of cardiovascular events.",

Neurological complications associated with CHIKV, although rare, have been reported in literature; however, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LTEM) is rarely associated with it. We present a case of a middle-aged man with a 1-week history of low-grade fever and arthralgia followed by urinary retention and quadriplegia. A sensory level was noted at T2. On subsequent investigations, he was diagnosed with LETM. Although LETM is commonly seen in patients with neuromyelitis optica, the other possible etiologies are inflammatory and parainfectious. To date, only two cases of LETM are reported worldwide in association with CHIKV fever and this is the first case from Pakistan. With frequent chikungunya outbreaks, neurological complications are increasingly seen in clinical practice. The knowledge of these associations will result in their early diagnosis and treatment.",

There is insufficient evidence to determine if children and adolescents receiving divalproex, onabotulinumtoxinA, amitriptyline, nimodipine and flunarizine are more or less likely than those receiving placebo to have a reduction in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving propranolol are possibly more likely than those receiving placebo to have an at least 50% reduction in headache frequency. Children and adolescents receiving topiramate and cinnarizine are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a decrease in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving amitriptyline plus cognitive behavioral therapy are more likely than those receiving amitriptyline plus headache education to have a reduction in headache frequency. Recommendations The majority of randomized controlled trials studying the efficacy of preventive medications for pediatric migraine fail to demonstrate superiority to placebo. Recommendations for the prevention of migraine in children include counseling on lifestyle and behavioral factors that influence headache frequency, and assessment and management of comorbid disorders associated with headache persistence. Clinicians should engage in shared decision making with patients and caregivers regarding the use of preventive treatments for migraine, including discussion of the limitations in the evidence to support pharmacologic treatments.",

Data on live births were obtained from the regional hospital statistics databases. Medical charts of infantile spasm cases were reviewed for demographic information, diagnostic workup results, treatment response, disease course, and developmental outcome.RESULTS: Forty-two infants with infantile spasms were identified. The cumulative incidence of infantile spasms up to the age of 2 years was 4.01 per 10 000 live births. Difference due to sex was minimal (22 males, 20 females) and most infants were delivered at or near term with gestational ages ranging between 30.0 and 41.8 weeks (median [interquartile range] 39.6wks [38.1-40.0wks]). The aetiology for infantile spasms was identified in almost two-thirds of cases, with HIE being the single most common cause (n=7). Other causes included chromosomal and monogenetic abnormalities (n=8). Infantile spasms occurred in moderate and severe grades of HIE, with a significantly higher incidence in those with severe HIE (p=0.029). Infants with severe HIE who did not receive therapeutic hypothermia were six times more likely to develop infantile spasms compared to those who did, but the difference was not statistically significant (4 out of 16 vs 1 out of 24, p=0.138).INTERPRETATION: This study provides detailed information about infantile spasms before and after the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia. HIE severity is a risk factor for the development of infantile spasms. The introduction of therapeutic hypothermia may have had an impact, but the effect was hard to ascertain in this cohort due to the small number of infants.WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The incidence of infantile spasms and patient characteristics in the southern region of the Republic of Ireland is similar to internationally published data. None of the infants with a history of mild hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) developed infantile spasms. The risk of infantile spasms was higher in infants with severe HIE. Infantile spasms were more frequent in infants with severe HIE not treated with therapeutic hypothermia.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Apixaban effectively lowers the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Systemic exposure to a given apixaban dose depends on multiple clearance pathways. Though routine quantification of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in neurological emergency situations has not been widely established, suspected associations of DOAC peak concentrations with bleeding events and DOAC trough concentrations with efficacy and safety suggest that such information might support clinical decision making.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 75 year-old woman with atrial fibrillation maintained on apixaban who was admitted due to suspected acute stroke. Clinical work-up did not confirm ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke but routine quantification of apixaban revealed an excessively high apixaban plasma concentration (~ 3 h after the last drug intake: 1100 ng/ml (expected range: 91-321 ng/ml); ~ 12 h after drug intake: 900 ng/ml (expected range: 41-230 ng/ml)) and a substantially prolonged elimination half-life (~ 31 h). The corresponding apixaban concentration-to-dose ratio was 9900 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg/d) and 8100 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg/d), respectively (expected range: 249-463 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg/d)). Renal function was only moderately impaired (creatinine 1.36 mg/dl (0.5-1.1 mg/dl), creatinine clearance 40 ml/min). Genotype analyses revealed that the patient was a CYP3A5*3/*3 non-expressor, a heterozygous carrier of the ABCG2 c.421C/A alleles, and a homozygous carrier of ABCB1 c.2677 T/T and ABCB1 c.3435 T/T. In the absence of known drug interactions explaining apixaban clearance impairment, excessive apixaban concentrations were most probably caused by moderate renal impairment combined with multiple functional polymorphisms of apixaban clearance pathways.CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that concurrent genetic polymorphisms can impair multiple apixaban elimination pathways and thus substantially increase its exposure.",

Although there are case report evidence of lumbar and thoracic vertebral fractures secondary to seizures, this is the first report of a spine injury resulting from a gelastic seizure.",

All patients in this series were evaluated in the Neuroimmunology and Autoimmune Neurology clinics at the University of Utah or the University of Colorado.Results: Thirteen of 17 patients had phenotypes more typically associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibody syndromes, consisting of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) with parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. One patient with parkinsonism had a presentation similar to rapidly progressive multiple system atrophy with severe dysautonomia. Ten of 17 patients had various visual symptoms including visual snow, spider web-like images forming shapes and 3-dimensional images, palinopsia, photophobia, visual hallucinations, synesthesia, and intermittent diplopia. Three of 17 patients presented with primarily autoimmune epilepsy accompanied by psychiatric symptoms.Conclusions: Clinicians should consider testing for GlyR antibodies in GAD65 antibody-negative or low-positive GAD65 antibody patients with SPS-like presentations, especially in the setting of atypical features such as visual disturbances, parkinsonism, or epilepsy.",

Methods: Clinical data from 30 MS patients ever treated with off-label RTX until mid-2018 at the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics were retrospectively collected and reviewed. The heterogeneous patient cohort included patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Outcome data (relapse rate and EDSS progression) as well as adverse effects for patients with a follow-up period of >12 months (n = 13) were recorded. Results: Following RTX administration, all patients with RRMS remained relapse free and had a stable or slightly improved EDSS score (mean EDSS before treatment = 6, mean EDSS at 12 months = 4.75). Patients with SPMS had a significant reduction in their relapse rate and a stabilization or slight improvement of their EDSS scores (mean EDSS before treatment = 6.25, mean EDSS at 12 months = 5.5). Only one of the patients with PPMS had a follow-up period of >12 months and his EDSS score remained unchanged. Rituximab infusions were generally well tolerated; there were only seven grade 3 or 4 adverse events recorded. Conclusion: Our results are in agreement with larger retrospective studies in which it was demonstrated that RTX was well tolerated and effective in treating RRMS and SPMS patients by reducing relapse rate and stabilizing disease.",

To our knowledge, this study represents the first focused report evaluating real-world evidence of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment via the PBS in Australian clinics.METHODS: This study reviewed the medical records of adults with inadequately controlled CM from 7 private neurology practices in Australia who, beginning in March 2014, received PBS-subsidized onabotulinumtoxinA per product labelling for the first time. The primary effectiveness measure was the percentage of patients achieving a response defined by 50% or greater reduction in headache days from baseline after 2 treatment cycles. Additional data were recorded in the case report form when available and included demographics, clinical characteristics, headache severity and frequency, Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score, medication use, and days missed of work or study at baseline, after 2 treatment cycles, and at last follow-up. Differences in mean changes from baseline were evaluated with a 1-tailed t-test or Pearson's chi-squared test (p < 0.05).RESULTS: The study population included 211 patients with a mean (SD) of 25.2 (5.3) monthly headache days at baseline. In the primary outcome analysis, 74% of patients achieved a response, with a mean (SD) of 10.6 (7.9) headache days after 2 treatment cycles (p < 0.001). Secondary effectiveness outcomes included mean (SD) reductions in HIT-6 score of - 11.7 (9.8) and - 11.8 (12.2) after 2 treatment cycles (p < 0.001) and final follow-up (p < 0.001), respectively, and mean (SD) decreases in days per month of acute pain medication use of - 11.5 (7.6) after 2 treatment cycles (p < 0.001) and - 12.7 (8.1) at final follow-up (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: This study provides additional clinical evidence for the consistent effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of CM in Australia. This effectiveness was made evident by reductions in migraine days, severe headache days, and HIT-6 scores from baseline.",

Whether surgical or medical treatment is more appropriate is controversial.The purpose of the study was to examine the morbidity and mortality rates of surgical and medical therapy and their differences in order to determine which patients should be operated.In our study, the authors selected randomly and evaluated retrospectively 49 patients who were operated in Haydarpa?a Numune Research and Education Hospital Neurosurgery Clinic and 51 patients who received medical therapy at Neurology Clinic for spontaneous supratentorial ICH between January 2007 and December 2011.The authors documented a detailed history of each patient featuring their neurological examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Modified Rankin Disability Scale (MRDS), imaging, age, gender, and history of stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and alcohol use, aspirin, or coumadin usage.As a result, the mortality rate found in our study was similar to previous studies (49%). Mortality of patients who underwent surgery (63%) found a higher rate of disability. This is because hematoma of the patients who were operated on larger volumes and diameters, GCS lower than and the higher MRDS scores, higher rates of herniation is connected. The authors concluded that very early operation does not create a difference in treatment between mortality rates. The authors observed that the most important factors for the prognosis of ICH patients whether operated or not are the GCS of patients at the time of arrival to the hospital and the nature of the hematoma.",

Methods: Clinical data of patients with anti-gaba B receptor encephalitis admitted to the department of neurology of the second hospital of hebei medical university from April 2016 to February 2018 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Results: Eight patients with anti-GABA (B) receptor encephalitis were included. All the eight cases presented with epileptic seizures. The initial symptoms were clinical seizures in six cases, memory deficit in one case, mental and behavior disorder in one case. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test indicated high intracranial pressure in four patients, increased protein in two patients and lymphocytosis in four patients. Long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal in all patients. Brain MRI showed limbic system lesions in four patients. The anti-GABA (B) receptor antibody was positive in both serum and CSF in all patients. Four patients had small cell lung cancer. All the eight patients received immunotherapy and symptoms were improved. After 6-24 months' follow-up, 1 patient recovered completely, and in the remaining 7 patients, mild symptoms were left behind. Conclusions: The anti-GABA (B) receptor encephalitis is characterized by refractory epilepsy. Epilepsy is the most common initial symptom. About 50% patients are accompanied by tumors. Anti-GABA (B) receptor antibodies testing and tumor screening should be actively carried out.",

However, the effect of AD on P-gp function in peripheral organs, and the impact on medication efficacy and toxicity is unknown. In this study, clinical chart review and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling were employed to determine whether disease-associated changes in P-gp could be assessed from clinically measured digoxin concentrations in patients without and with dementia.METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted to compare digoxin dose and concentrations between cohorts. A PBPK model was developed to simulate changes in digoxin concentrations at single and multiple 62.5 and 125 ìg/d doses due to reduced P-gp function in peripheral organs.RESULTS: Digoxin concentrations were similar between the nondementia (n = 75) and dementia (n = 72) cohorts (mean ± standard deviation; 0.64 ± 0.31 and 0.60 ± 0.34 ng/mL, respectively; -0.06 to 0.15, 95% confidence interval of difference). PBPK simulations showed that reduced P-gp function resulted in a significant increase in digoxin exposure (AUC), but not in Cmax . For example, when a 2-fold reduction in P-gp function was simulated in older people following multiple 125 ìg/d digoxin doses, the AUC over the last dosing interval was increased compared to baseline (24.29 ± 3.94 vs 17.04 ± 3.46 ng/mL*h; 4.52 to 9.98); however, Cmax was similar (1.38 ± 0.20 vs 0.99 ± 0.18 ng/mL; -2.33 to 3.13).CONCLUSION: Clinically measured digoxin concentrations were not statistically different in patients with dementia. Based on PBPK simulations, digoxin AUC may need to be evaluated to adequately assess the impact of reduced P-gp function in peripheral organs.",

      "abstractText": "Understanding the architecture of transcallosal connections would allow for more specific assessments of neurodegeneration across many fields of neuroscience, neurology, and psychiatry. To map these connections, we conducted probabilistic tractography in 100 Human Connectome Project subjects in 32 cortical areas using novel post-processing algorithms to create a spatially precise Trancallosal Tract Template (TCATT). We found robust transcallosal tracts in all 32 regions, and a topographical analysis in the corpus callosum largely agreed with well-established subdivisions of the corpus callosum. We then obtained diffusion MRI data from a cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and another with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and used a two-compartment model to calculate free-water corrected fractional anisotropy (FAT) and free-water (FW) within the TCATT. These metrics were used to determine between-group differences and to determine which subset of tracts was best associated with cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)). In AD, we found robust between-group differences in FW (31/32 TCATT tracts) in the absence of between-group differences in FAT. FW in the inferior temporal gyrus TCATT tract was most associated with MoCA scores in AD. In PSP, there were widespread differences in both FAT and FW, and MoCA was predicted by FAT in the inferior frontal pars triangularis, preSMA, and medial frontal gyrus TCATT tracts as well as FW in the inferior frontal pars opercularis TCATT tract. The TCATT improves spatial localization of corpus callosum measurements to enhance the evaluation of treatment effects, as well as the monitoring of brain microstructure in relation to cognitive dysfunction and disease progression. Here, we have shown its direct relevance in capturing between-group differences and associating it with the MoCA in AD and PSP.",

The discovery of novel cell surface antibodies and antibodies directed at ion channels has revolutionized our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and the diagnostic tools at hand. Early diagnosis is crucial to initiation of treatment early in the disease course, which ameliorates the neurological outcome.OBJECTIVES: To delineate the clinical, imaging and laboratory characteristics of patients with AIE, as reflected in the cohort of limbic encephalitis patients treated in our department.METHODS: Patients diagnosed with AIE in our department in 2008-2018 were included in this retrospective study. All patients met the criteria for clinically probable or definite AIE, based on their clinical, laboratory and imaging findings, and the identification of causative autoantibodies.RESULTS: A total of 27 patients with a diagnosis of AIE were diagnosed and treated in our department in 2008-2018; 74% had an amnestic disorder and 70% developed seizures. Psychosis was observed in 37%, though 63% showed behavioral changes; 59% had clinically relevant autoantibodies in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately half had pathologic brain imaging (59%) and only 33% had CSF pleocytosis. Despite immunosuppressive treatment, residual neurologic deficits were seen in the majority of the patients.DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of AIE relies mainly on the clinical presentation, with normal ancillary studies in many cases. Thus, high clinical suspicion and prompt initiation of treatment despite lack of objective evidence of the diagnosis are necessary to limit the neurological sequela. Moreover, high awareness of AIE may allow appropriate workup and diagnosis in atypical cases.",

This study highlights certain factors affecting outcome of SICH managed in a Nigerian Neurosurgical centre, on a background of the modernisation of the patient care facilities.Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients managed for SICH at Memfys Hospital for Neurosurgery and Neurology in Enugu from years 2009-2016. All patients had computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis. Treatment included medical, surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) care. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage and trauma were excluded. Factors analysed include age, admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), haematoma location, complications encountered during admission, duration of hospital stay and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS).Results: There were 66 cases, age range of 21-85 years (mean 57 years). A total of 30 (45.5%) patients were admitted with GCS ? 8/15; 63.3% of these died within 6 months. The proportion of mortalities was 63.6% (>70 years) and 35.6% (41-70 years). Most commonly associated complication was chest infection 27 (40.9%), with 56.6% mortality. Common haematoma locations were basal ganglia (43.9%) and lobar haemorrhage (40.9%) with a similar effect on outcome (P = 0.098). Outcomes were GOS 1: (43.9%), GOS 5: (30.3%) and GOS 4: (13.6%). Among 42 (63.3%) admitted to ICU, 25 (59.5%) died, while 11 (26.2%) achieved GOS of ? 4 at 6 months. Those discharged between days 11 and 20 had 26.7% mortality while 53.3% were independent.Conclusion: Good admission GCS, absence of chest infections, younger age group are predictors of good outcome following SICH. Anatomical location of haemorrhage alone does not have a significant impact on 6 months' mortality.",

It is not clear that the effect of SES on stroke in China due to the lack of relevant research. We aimed to assess the association between SES and risks of first-ever ischemic stroke in Guangzhou, China.METHODS: Cases were recruited from neurology department in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University during September 2016-October 2017. Age- and sex-matched controls were derived from surgical departments, over the same period. SES was assessed based on education, occupation, and income. Education was divided into ?6 years, 6-9 years, 10-12 years, and > 12 years. Family monthly income per capita was categorized into ?¥1000, ¥1001-3000, ¥3001-5000, and > ¥5001. Occupation was stratified into manual, non-manual, no job, and retired. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the association between SES and risk of ischemic stroke.RESULTS: In total, 347 ischemic stroke patients and 347 controls were recruited, with mean ages of 60.54 ± 13.13 and 60.56 ± 13.07 years, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, odds ratio (OR) for 6-9 years of education was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45-4.75); > 12 years, 2.18 (1.25-3.82) compared with those for < 6 years of education. ORs for the second lowest, third lowest, and highest incomes were 1.96 (1.21-3.15), 4.16 (2.39-7.22), and 2.83(1.25-6.39), respectively, compared with those for the lowest income. ORs for manual workers and non-manual workers were 1.95 (1.23-3.07) and 1.87 (1.05-3.33), compared with individuals without jobs.CONCLUSIONS: Higher SES is positively related with risks of ischemic stroke, explained by cardiovascular diseases and unhealthy lifestyles in Guangzhou, China. Thus, effective strategies such as extensive health education, promoting a healthy lifestyle, screening for risk factors to prevent stroke should be implemented to reduce ischemic stroke incidences among the high SES group.",

Mexico is a middle-income country with little information about the prognosis of early and late postischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the factors associated with post-stroke survival in the Mexican population.METHODS: Observational study of consecutive stroke cases involving a first-ever hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, with patients who received care at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, in Mexico City, between 2009 and 2012. Patients were followed for up to 4 years after the index event. Exploratory analysis of survival was carried out with Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. Factors associated with survival time were determined using Cox models.RESULTS: A total of 300 out of 544 (55.15%) patients had a hemorrhagic stroke, 135 of 544 (24.82%) patients died during the entire follow-up period, and 56 of 544 (10.29%) died in the first 30 days post-stroke (early mortality). Early mortality after stroke was associated with age ? 65 years (Adjusted Hazard Ratio - AHR = 2.07, P = .02) and ? 2 in-hospital medical complications (AHR = 46.13, P < .01). Late mortality was associated with age ? 65 years (AHR = 3.43, P < .01), ?2 in-hospital medical complications (AHR = 2.55, P < .01), high comorbidity (AHR = 5.43, P < .01), and recurrence (AHR = 1.90, P = .01).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke who presented in-hospital medical complications, high comorbidity, and were over 65 years old had higher rates of early and late mortality.",

However, the impact of abruption on the long-term morbidity of the offspring is less investigated.METHODS: We designed a hospital-based cohort study, in which the incidence of long-term neurology-related hospitalisations of offspring to women with and without placental abruption was assessed. All singleton deliveries between 1991 and 2014 were included in the study. Congenital anomalies, perinatal mortality, and multifetal pregnancies were excluded from the analyses. We compared cumulative morbidity incidence using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and estimated the risk for long-term neurological hospitalisations from Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for putative including maternal age, parity, hypertensive disorders, pre-gestational and gestational diabetes, gender, ethnicity, and year of birth.RESULTS: Over the 22-year period, 2 202 269 person-years of follow-up, there were 217 910 deliveries of which 0.5% (n = 1003) were complicated with placental abruption. The median (interquartile range) follow-up of children in the abruption and non-abruption groups was 10.3 (4.6, 15.9) and 12.0 (6.3, 16.5) years, respectively. The cumulative incidence of total neurological hospitalisations was comparable between abruption (3.32 per 1000 person-years) and non-abruption (3.16 per 1000 person-years). Abruption was associated with increased rates of cerebral palsy (hazard ratio [HR] 6.71, 95% CI 3.32, 13.58) and developmental disorders (HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.38, 8.13), but not for total neurology-related hospitalisations (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.78, 1.49).CONCLUSION: Placental abruption is associated with increased rate of cerebral palsy and developmental disorders in the offspring later in life. This study may define risk factors for childhood neuropsychiatric disorders, enabling early diagnosis and intervention in children with such disorders, and perhaps improving their prognosis.",

In this study, we established the microbial etiologies of UTI, and resistances to antibiotics in UTI as well as determining which appropriate empirical antibiotics should be used to treat UTI in neurological patients.DESIGNS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed microbial etiologies and antimicrobial resistance among patients experiencing UTI events in the neurology ward of Seoul National University Hospital from 2007 to 2016.RESULTS: The total number of UTI events observed was 301, and Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common pathogen observed in UTIs. But in catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI), Enterococcus species were the most prevalent pathogens. Susceptibility to commonly-prescribed antibiotics decreased over 10 years, indicating increased antibiotic resistance in pathogens associated with UTI. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae increased significantly, while increases of MDR K. pneumoniae, ESBL-producing E. coli, and VRE were not observed.CONCLUSIONS: The worldwide trend of increasing drug-resistant pathogens should be considered, and further studies on antibiotics resistance in UTI are needed. These data will greatly assist physicians when they select antibiotics to treat UTIs in neurological patients.",

Progress MRI displayed characteristic T2 ribboning on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, along with periodic sharp wave complexes on electroencephalogram (EEG) and a raised CSF protein 14-3-3. Repeat serum, as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), GAD antibodies were again markedly elevated as measured by ELISA (RSR, Cardiff, UK), although archival CSF from the original presentation as well as CSF from the second presentation had undetectable GAD autoantibodies as measured via radioimmunoassay (DIAsource, Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium).

Since social and cultural differences can potentially affect the cutoff score of NDDI-E, in this study, the reliability and validity of the Indian version of the NDDI-E in PWE was determined.METHOD: After ethical clearance, 217 PWE above 18 years of age, on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), attending neurology outpatient department (OPD) of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India, were evaluated for depression using the NDDI-E (Indian version) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-Module A, version 6.0.0) as reference standard. Informed consent was taken before recruitment. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Cronbach's á, a measure of the internal consistency and reliability, were carried out to validate cutoff and questionnaire, respectively.RESULTS: Of the 217 PWE (112 males/105 females), mean age of 28.6 ± 9.4 years, with generalized (69.1%) or focal seizures (30.9%), 41.5% and 10.6% were diagnosed with depression using MINI and NDDI-E Indian version (at cutoff >15), respectively. However, at a cutoff score of >11, the Indian version of NDDI-E had a sensitivity of 96.67%, a specificity of 84.25%, a positive predictive value of 81.31%, and a negative predictive value of 97.27%. ROC analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9547 (confidence interval (CI) 95% = 0.929-0.979; standard error (SE): 0.0127). With the Indian version of NDDI-E, the Cronbach's á value was 0.877.CONCLUSION: A periodic assessment of PWE using a quickly administrable and reliable tool for screening depression is highly desirable given the high incidence. In the Indian population with a cutoff of >11, NDDI-E is a reliable and valid instrument to screen depression in PWE.",

It can manifest as hemiparesis, cortical blindness, speech changes, Parkinsonism, confusion, seizure, and coma. Most of the reported CIE cases have been transient and reversible. Irreversible fatal CIE cases have been rarely reported. All the fatal CIE cases reported involved the use of ionic high osmolar contrast agents. Here, we document a heretofore unreported fatal CIE after digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using iopamidol, which is a type of non-ionic monomer low osmolar contrast agent.CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our Department of Neurology for tinnitus in the head. The cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) detected atherosclerotic cerebral arteries and bilateral stenosis of the middle cerebral arteries. The patient underwent DSA for further diagnostic work-up. The total amount of iopamidol used during the procedure was 110 ml. The patient experienced headache during the procedure, followed by dizziness with nausea and vomiting. Despite treatment with anti-oedema medications, her clinical status was gradually deteriorating and ended up with deep coma due to irreversible cerebral oedema which was confirmed by cerebral computed tomography (CT). Finally, the patient died 56 days after the procedure due to irreversible fatal cerebral oedema.CONCLUSIONS: This report documents that iopamidol-induced encephalopathy may not always have a benign outcome and can result in irreversible fatal cerebral oedema.",

This study uses complementary bibliometric approaches to assess the scope, influence, and interdisciplinary collaboration of publications supported by single CTSA hubs and those supported by multiple hubs. Authors identified articles acknowledging CTSA support and assessed the disciplinary scope of research areas represented in that publication portfolio, their citation influence, interdisciplinary overlap among research categories, and characteristics of publications supported by multihub collaborations. Since 2006, CTSA hubs supported 69,436 articles published in 4,927 journals and 189 research areas. The portfolio is well distributed across diverse research areas with above-average citation influence. Most supported publications involved clinical/health sciences, for example, neurology and pediatrics; life sciences, for example, neuroscience and immunology; or a combination of the two. Publications supported by multihub collaborations had distinct content emphasis, stronger citation influence, and greater interdisciplinary overlap. This study characterizes the CTSA consortium's contributions to clinical and translational science, identifies content areas of strength, and provides evidence for the success of multihub collaborations. These methods lay the foundation for future investigation of the best policies and priorities for fostering translational science and allow hubs to understand their progress benchmarked against the larger consortium.",

A portion of HDLS patients exhibit preferential motor dysfunctions as their initial symptoms, mimicking multiple sclerosis (MS). However, there is no study comparing this phenotype of HDLS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), which greatly resemble each other. This is the first preliminary study to clarify the clinical and neuroimaging features of motor-predominant HDLS, and compare it with PPMS, using cases whose colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) were sequenced.METHODS: Clinical and radiological data from Japanese patients at the Department of Neurology, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan, were evaluated retrospectively and cross-sectionally. Twenty-nine brain and 18 spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from four motor-predominant HDLS patients with CSF1R mutations and 15 PPMS patients without CSF1R mutations, were evaluated using an HDLS MRI scoring system.RESULTS: Two patients with HDLS were initially diagnosed with MS and received immunotherapy. Clinically, motor-predominant HDLS and PPMS patients resembled each other in onset age and disability. However, motor-predominant HDLS patients had a significantly higher frequency of frontal release signs, lower positivity rates of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCB), and lower IgG index values. Total HDLS MRI scores, total white matter lesions (WMLs), and brain atrophy were similar between the diseases. However, motor-predominant HDLS patients had more marked atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) body, more WMLs in the deep and subcortical regions of the frontoparietal lobes, fewer WMLs in the occipitotemporal periventricular regions, and more restricted diffusivity lesions on MRI than PPMS patients. There was a stronger association between disease duration and CC index in HDLS, suggesting more rapid progression compared with PPMS.CONCLUSIONS: Motor-predominant HDLS has characteristic frequent frontal release signs, normal findings for OCB and the IgG index, severe CC body atrophy, abundant deep and subcortical WMLs in the frontoparietal lobes, subtle occipitotemporal lobe periventricular WMLs, and more restricted diffusivity lesions on MRI. Although the present study was limited by the small number of HDLS cases, we propose that immunotherapy should be avoided in such cases.",

We examined predictors of 7-day and 30-day readmissions for pediatric patients hospitalized with a neurologic diagnosis.METHODS: This was a retrospective study of hospital readmission rates in pediatric neurology patients admitted to a tertiary children's hospital from January 2017 to December 2017. Inclusion criteria were age ?18 years and a primary neurologic diagnosis on admission, with an unplanned readmission within 7 or 30 days. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including age, sex, income, insurance type, discharge occurring on a weekend, admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), use of multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and involvement of multiple subspecialties.RESULTS: There were 923 neurology admissions, and 64 readmissions within 30 days. Total unplanned readmission rate was 6.9%, with 56% (36/64) readmitted within 30 days, 44% (28/64) readmitted within 7 days, and 11% (7/64) admitted multiple times within 30 days. The most common readmission diagnosis was seizure (62%), followed by other neurologic diagnosis (21%), headache (8%), encephalitis/meningitis (7%), stroke (1%), and ataxia (1%). Readmission was significantly associated with multiple AED, PICU admission, seizure with major complication or comorbidity, and presence of a major complication or comorbidity irrespective of diagnosis (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies factors associated with higher rates of readmission for pediatric neurology patients. Patients with epilepsy and chronic neurologic conditions should be targeted for future discharge-related interventions to reduce hospital readmission and ensure safe transitions from the inpatient to the outpatient setting.",

Antibodies associated with paraneoplastic encephalopathies are, among others, anti-Hu, anti-Ma2 and, in part, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA)-receptor antibodies. Here, we present the case of a 72-year-old patient hospitalised due to progressive cognitive decline and disorientation. Diagnostic workup revealed paraneoplastic anti-amphiphysin associated limbic encephalitis on the basis of an aortic angiosarcoma with metastases to kidney, muscle and bones. Highly aggressive chemotherapy as well as immunosuppressive therapy and cytoreductive laparoscopic nephrectomy were initiated. However, follow-up revealed further tumour progress and a worsening of neurological symptoms.",

Using self-reported questionnaires, we assessed psychiatric symptoms, such as stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS), depression (Patient Health Question 9, PHQ9), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7, GAD7). According to the disease subtypes, we analyzed the psychiatric scales based on gender and age group. The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities was lowest in patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and highest among patients with cognitive decline and epilepsy. The overall prevalence of psychiatric symptoms markedly decreased with age. This decline was statistically significant for all questionnaires (PSS ? 14, p for trend = 0.027; PQH9 ? 10, p for trend = 0.005; GAD7 ? 10, p for trend = 0.002) and was more pronounced in males. Considering the high incidence of undetected psychiatric comorbidities and their associated burden, proactive psychiatric management should be included in neurological care. Psychiatric questionnaires could also be an effective screening tool for identifying psychiatric symptoms accompanying neurological symptoms.",

Methods: Retrospective series of case studies. The clinical data of 6 cases (9 eyes) of AION associated with BD who were hospitalized at the neurology ward of Beijing Tongren Hospital from February to June in 2016 were collected, the clinical characteristics of these patients were summarized, visual acuity were compared by using Wingerchuk visual grade before and after treatment. Results: Among the 6 patients with AION associated with BD, there were 4 males and 2 female, aged 38-60 years. All patients were acute onset, 3 cases had the onset of one eye, 2 cases with the onset of both eyes and 1 case with successively onset of both eyes. Optic nerve was damaged in 6 cases (9 eyes), only 1 case felt pain of eyes, the best corrected visual acuity of 4 eyes were less than 0.1, optic disk edema and linear bleeding around optic disk were oberved in all patients, the lower half visual field defect was the most common damage type (5 eyes), P100 latency of visual evoked potential prolonged in all patients, optic nerve MRI showed abnormal signal of optic nerve involvement in 2 patients. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and followed for 3 months, there was significant improvement in 1 eye of which the vision improved above 3 grade, and improvement in 6 eyes of which vision improved for 1-2 grade, while there has been no change in 2 eyes. Conclusions: BD may be the etiology of AION. Visual impairment of this kind of patients is relatively serious, visual function is expected to improve with early treatment.

The product was comprised of a double layer of polypropylene nonwoven fabric and 100% cotton interlock fabric with a 3-ply 100% cotton interlock fabric added into the perianal section. Participants wore the product for 8 hours and were asked to defecate into the product and evaluate its comfort, ability to contain liquids and protect privacy, any personal allergic reaction, and air permeability. In part 2, after any product modifications, 12 bedridden women treated in the neurology unit of a hospital in western Turkey who had an indwelling urinary catheter and fecal incontinence and who did not have diabetes mellitus, a darkly pigmented area in the perianal area, pressure injury, or erythema were randomized to 2 groups (study product and control, a premium adult diaper) and monitored for 8 days for the development and severity of perineal dermatitis (scored from 0 [no erythema] to 4 [broken, abraded skin]) using a skin assessment tool. Any type of erythema was considered IAD. Skin care (cleansing with a washcloth and water) was provided daily and after each defecation to all study participants. Data were collected via paper-and-pencil completion of the perineal skin integrity assessment and patient observation forms and entered into and analyzed by a computerized statistical program. Fisher's exact test and the chi-squared test were used to analyze the difference in IAD incidence and severity between the 2 groups, and the Mann Whitney U test was used to detect differences in the number and consistency of defecations.RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were noted among the characteristics of the 12 participants (6 in each group) except for age; patients in the study product group were significantly older (70.66 ± 10.36 vs 52.20 ± 16.78 years; P <.05. Four (4) patients in the study group exhibited 13 areas of perineal dermatitis (degree 1 = 6 areas; degree 2 = 6 areas; degree 3 = 1 area; and degree 4 = 0); 1 patient in the control group had 4 areas with degree 1.CONCLUSION: This prototype product is not sufficient to be used in clinical practice in patients with fecal incontinence, but further study in a larger population is warranted..",

Methods: Two spontaneous collagen type ?-related myopathy patients were admitted to Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital, Capital Institute of Pediatrics in October 2017. Clinical data of probands and their family members were collected and their genomic DNA was obtained for genetic testing. Next generation sequencing was performed and the variants were verified by the Sanger sequencing in the family members. Results: Target region sequencing indicated that the proband of family 1 has carried a heterozygous variant of COL6A3 gene, c.6229G>C(p.Gly2077Arg), and it was de novo variant confirmed by Sanger-sequencing in the family.The patient 1, a 2-year-three-month old boy, was admitted due to motor retardation at birth. He was defined as early severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. He never achieved independent ambulation, he had onset of symptoms was found at birth, including diffuse muscle weakness, striking distal joint hyperlaxity, proximal contractures, calcaneal protrusion, kyphosis, and hip dislocation. Serum CK level was elevated slightly and EMG showed neurogenic changes. The patient 2, a 7-year-old girl with a limp for 4 years, carried one de novo variant of COL6A3 gene,c.5169_5177del (p.Glu1724_Leu1726del). This variant results in the deletion of amino acids (1724 to 1726) in á3 chain of collagen ?, which may disturb the function of this protein.She was diagnosed as Bethlem myopathy with a mild phenotype. She had delayed motor milestones and presented with walking on tiptoe, hypotonia, and ithylordosis. The contracture of proximal joints was not very obvious. Serum CK level was normal and EMG showed myogenic changes.Muscle biopsy revealed muscular dystrophy and muscle magnetic resonance imaging of patient 2 showed vastus lateral is a \"sandwich\" sign. Immunofluorescence staining for COL6A3 chain in the cultured skin fibroblasts from patients 2 showed decreased deposition compared with control. Conclusions: These two patients were diagnosed as spontaneous collagen type ?-related myopathy and carried different variants of COL6A3 gene. Different in pathogenetic variants could cause different genetic features and different phenotypes. Collagen type ?- related myopathy patients have various clinical manifestations. Typical phenotypes include muscular dystrophies, proximal contractures, and distal hyperlaxity. Muscle MRI shows diffuse fatty infiltration of gluteus maximus and thigh muscle. The histological staining showed the low level expression of COL6A3 chain. The seventy of phenotype was related to the genotype.",

We assigned daily PM2.5 and ozone estimates for 2005-2012 from US EPA's Fused Air Quality Surface Using Downscaling model to each participant for each day based on the mother's census tract of residence at birth. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) using logistic regression across continuous and categorical exposure window averages (trimesters, first and second postnatal years, and cumulative measure), adjusting for maternal- and birth-related confounders, both air pollutants, and multiple temporal exposure windows.RESULTS: We detected elevated aORs for PM2.5 during the 2nd trimester, 1st year of life, and a cumulative period from pregnancy through the 2nd year (aOR ranges across categories: 1.41-1.44, 1.54-1.84, and 1.41-1.52 respectively), and for ozone in the 2nd year of life (aOR range across categories: 1.29-1.42). Per each change in IQR, we observed elevated aORs for ozone in the 3rd trimester, 1st and 2nd years of life, and the cumulative period (aOR range: 1.19-1.27) and for PM2.5 in the 2nd trimester, 1st year of life, and the cumulative period (aOR range: 1.11-1.17).DISCUSSION: We saw limited evidence of linear exposure-response relationships for ASD with increasing air pollution, but the elevated aORs detected for PM2.5 in upper exposure categories and per IQR unit increases were similar in magnitude to those reported in previous studies, especially for postnatal exposures.",

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were applied. Eligible patients were diagnosed with a brain tumour, were seizure na?ve and underwent craniotomy. The random effects model was used for quantitative synthesis. The analysis was adjusted for the confounding effect of including patients with a history of seizure prior to study inclusion.RESULTS: A total of 454 patients received prophylactic AED whereas 333 were allocated to placebo or no treatment. Two RCTs and four retrospective studies were identified. The OR was 1.09 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.8, p=0.7, I2=5.6%, ÷2 p=0.5), indicating study consistency and no significant differences. An additional two RCTs and one retrospective study combined craniotomy and diagnostic biopsy, and were subgroup analysed-which supported no difference in odds for epilepsy.CONCLUSIONS: A prophylactic effect of AED could not be demonstrated (nor rejected statistically). Levetiracetam was associated with less adverse effects than phenytoin. The potential harm of AED was not balanced by the potential prophylactic benefit. This study suggests that prophylactic AED should not be administered to prevent brain tumour-related epilepsy after craniotomy.",

The purpose of this study was to summarize perceptions about best practices for the care of adult spina bifida patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national survey was electronically distributed to 174 urologists who are current members of the Spina Bifida Association Network and AUA Working Group on Urologic Congenitalism. De-identified voluntary responses were assessed for implementation of and barriers to interdisciplinary adult SB clinics, continuity of care, and practices for transitioning from pediatric to adult care.RESULTS: The response rate was 40% with urologists practicing pediatrics, genitourinary reconstruction, female pelvic medicine and general urology. Patients undergoing transition or who have transitioned were seen in a multidisciplinary clinic (14%), regular adult clinic (34%), combined adult-pediatric multidisciplinary care (20%), or pediatric multidisciplinary clinic (28%). A majority believed transitioning to adult care should occur at 18 (24%) or 21 years (22%). In the absence of acute changes, providers followed adult SB patients annually with upper tract imaging (typically renal ultrasound) and serum creatinine. Acute urologic changes were preferentially managed with urodynamic testing and cystoscopy. Providers identified a need for multidisciplinary care in adult life, with neurosurgery/neurology (87%), social work (84%), and orthopedics (73%).CONCLUSIONS: Potential solutions to improve the urologic care of this population suggest additional national provider resources, standardized guidelines, multidisciplinary collaboration, access to care, and an advanced-training pathway to improve care of adult patients with spina bifida.",

Brain MRI disclosed isolated hyperintense signal on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence involving the medulla and the right inferior cerebellar peduncle with moderate swelling, consistent with vasogenic oedema, without abnormalities on diffusion-weighted imaging sequence. PRES diagnosis was suspected and antihypertensive therapy was introduced to achieve a blood pressure goal < 140/90 mmHg, allowing a quickly favourable clinical course. Three months later, brain MRI demonstrated a complete clearance of the abnormalities, confirming the PRES diagnosis. Atypical MRI findings are possible with involvement of basal ganglia, brainstem or cerebellum, but in these cases, oedema is most of the time accompanied by the classical parieto-occipital region involvement. Vasogenic oedema strictly unilateral or involving exclusively the brainstem or the cerebellum are very rare and should prompt suspicion for an alternative diagnosis. That constitutes a crucial diagnosis challenge in neurology.",

It was speculated that pre-stroke warfarin may promote collateralization and result in reduced stroke severity. This study aimed to investigate the association between pre-stroke warfarin use and leptomeningeal collaterals in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.METHODS: We enrolled consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients (occlusion of the middle cerebral artery within 24 h) with known history of AF and/or RHD at the neurology department of the West China Hospital from May 2011 to April 2017. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) before treatment was used to detect the thrombus. Regional leptomeningeal collateral (rLMC) score based on CTA images was used to assess collateral circulation. Prior use of warfarin was recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect the association of prior warfarin use with the collateral circulation.RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included; 29 (24.2%) were taking warfarin before stroke. The international normalized ratio (INR) in patients with prior warfarin use was 1.53 ± 1.00, compared with 1.02 ± 0.09 in patients without prior warfarin use (P < 0.001). Prior oral warfarin therapy was inversely associated with poor rLMC (OR = 0.07, 95%CI 0.01-0.44, P = 0.005). There were no associations between prior warfarin use and initial stroke severity or functional outcomes at 3 months.CONCLUSION: Warfarin use seems improve collateralization in patients with acute stroke. However, clinical controlled studies should be used to verify this claim.",

Patients admitted to the Department of Neurology (September 2011-August 2014) were evaluated; those with a first episode of acute unilateral CR infarction involving the CBT and with LA were included. The 'Case' group comprised patients with LA involving the contralateral CBT; the 'Control' group comprised patients with LA not involving the contralateral CBT. The primary outcome was the feeding method at discharge; secondary outcomes were the feeding method at admission and results of the bedside swallowing test, videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale, penetration-aspiration scale, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association National Outcome Measurement System Swallowing Scale (ASHA NOMS), oral transit time, and pharyngeal transit time. Infarct size was measured using brain magnetic resonance imaging; LA severity was rated using the Fazekas scale. Eighty-one patients were included (mean age 64.6 ± 11.5 years; 64% male; Case group: 20, 5 underwent VFSS; Control group: 67, 11 underwent VFSS). The Case group was older and had higher total Fazekas scale score than the Control group. The feeding method at discharge and ASHA NOMS score were significantly worse in the Case group than in the Control group. Multivariate analysis revealed that LA involving the contralateral CBT independently predicted the feeding method at discharge and ASHA NOMS score. In conclusion, LA involving the contralateral CBT is associated with dysphagia in patients with unilateral CR infarction involving the CBT.",

The serum (Ca, P, Mg, Fe) concentration of 4 essential elements was measured with a biochemical device. The groups were correlated in terms of four essential element concentrations. The severity of the disease was measured using Lee's Quality of Life Scale and correlated with the concentration of four trace elements. The results were compared using the independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test.Results: Concentration of serum Ca, P, and Mg in the HFS patients was found to be lower in the control group which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no statistically difference between the groups in terms of Fe concentration (P > 0.05). There was no significant correlation between trace element concentration and severity of illness and daily life quality in the patient group.Conclusion: These results show us the role of HFS in the pathogenesis of these four trace elements and the importance of its location in etiology. We think that changes in the concentration of trace elements in HFS can lead to demyelinization, which may lead to spasm.",

To date, no study has directly explored physician practices for treatment of acute migraine in pregnant women.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of medication administration for pregnant women who presented to an acute care setting with a migraine attack and received neurology consultation between 2009 and 2014.RESULTS: We identified 72 pregnant women with migraine who were treated with pain medications. Fifty-one percent (37/72) were in the third trimester of pregnancy, 39% (28/72) in the second trimester, and 10% (7/72) in the first trimester. Thirty-two percent (23/72) had not tried any acute medications at home before coming to the hospital, and 47% (34/72) presented in status migrainosus. Patients received treatment in the hospital for a median of 23 hours (interquartile range = 5-45 hours). The most common medications prescribed were metoclopramide in 74% (53/72) of patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 62-82%) and acetaminophen in 69% (50/72) of patients (95% CI 58-79%). Metoclopramide was administered along with diphenhydramine in 81% (44/53) of patients (95% CI 71-91%). Acetaminophen was the most frequent medicine administered first (53%, 38/72). Patients were often treated with butalbital (35%, 25/72) or opioids (30%, 22/72), which were used as second- or third-line treatments in 29% of patients (20/72). Thirty-eight percent (27/72) received an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus, 24% received IV magnesium (17/72), and 6% (4/72) had peripheral nerve blocks performed.CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of pregnant women with acute migraine received medications considered relatively safe in pregnancy, there was variation in treatment choice and sequence. Some acute medications considered potentially hazardous for fetal health and less effective for migraine (opioids and butalbital) were used frequently, whereas other treatments that may have low teratogenic risk (nerve blocks, IV fluid boluses, and triptans) were used less or not at all. These results indicate a need for developing guidelines and protocols to standardize acute treatment of migraine in pregnancy.",

A lumbar MRI revealed minimal disc protrusion at L3 and a partially visualised left-sided kidney abnormality. Abdominal and pelvic CT demonstrated severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney compressing the left psoas major. The patient was immediately referred to an outside hospital for nephrology workup, and following nephrostomy tube, his radicular pain resolved. He remained asymptomatic at 4 weeks follow-up. We found two cases of postsurgical, retroperitoneal fluid collection that caused lumbar radiculopathy, but none associated with hydronephrosis. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to report hydronephrosis as the potential aetiology of lumbar radiculopathy, which highlights an important clinical reminder: to consider extraspinal aetiologies in all patients who present with lumbar radiculopathy, when clinical symptoms, examination findings and diagnostic studies present with unusual characteristics.",

We aimed to quantify the burden of PNCC through generation of national estimates of disease incidence, utilization of critical care interventions (CCI), and hospital outcomes.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of the Kids Inpatient Database over three years to evaluate pediatric traumatic brain injury, neuro-infection or inflammatory diseases, status epilepticus, stroke, hypoxic ischemic injury after cardiac arrest, and spinal cord injury. We evaluated use of CCI, death, length of stay, hospital charges, and poor functional outcome defined as receipt of tracheostomy or gastrostomy or discharge to a medical care facility.RESULTS: At least one CCI was recorded in 67,058 (23%) children with a primary neurological diagnosis, and considered a PNCC admission. Over half of PNCC admissions had at least one chronic condition, and 23% were treated in children's hospitals. Mechanical ventilation was the most common CCI, but utilization of CCIs varied significantly by diagnosis. Among PNCC admissions, 8110 (12%) children died during hospitalization and 14,067 (21%) children had poor functional outcomes. PNCC admissions cumulatively accounted for over 1.5 million hospital days and over $4 billion in hospital costs in the study years. Most PNCC admissions, across all diagnoses, had prolonged hospitalizations (more than one week) with an average cost of $39.9 thousand per admission.CONCLUSIONS: This large, nationally representative study shows PNCC diseases are a significant public health burden with substantial risk to children's health. More research is needed to improve outcomes in these vulnerable children.",

Interviews with five mentees and six mentors were carried out. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis.SETTING: The first mentoring session took place predischarge from the rehabilitation unit. The remaining five sessions took place in mentees' homes or community as preferred.PARTICIPANTS: Twelve people with TBI took part: six mentees (with moderate to severe TBI; aged 18-46) paired with six mentors (moderate to severe TBI >12 months previously; aged 21-59). Pairing occurred before mentee discharge from postacute inpatient brain injury rehabilitation. Mentors had been discharged from rehabilitation following a TBI between 1 and 5 years previously.INTERVENTION: The peer mentoring programme consisted of up to six face-to-face sessions between a mentee and a mentor over a 6-month period. The sessions focused on building rapport, exploring hopes for and supporting participation after discharge through further meetings and supported community activities.RESULTS: Data were synthesised into one overarching theme: making sense of recovery. This occurred through the sharing of experiences and stories; was pivotal to the mentoring relationship; and appeared to benefit both mentees and mentors. Mentors were perceived as valued experts because of their personal experience of injury and recovery, and could provide support in ways that were different from that provided by clinicians or family members. Mentors required support to manage the uncertainties inherent in the role.CONCLUSIONS: The insight mentors developed through their own lived experience established them as a trusted and credible source of hope and support for people re-engaging in the community post-TBI. These findings indicate the potential for mentoring to result in positive outcomes.",

Data were input to a web-based data capture system (REDCap) by data entry personnel trained in data software use and operational definitions of data variables. Data on demographics, trauma type (blunt vs penetrating), preadmission care, hospitalization and intensive care requirement, trauma severity assessment at presentation (eg, modified Glasgow coma scale and animal trauma triage score), key laboratory parameters, necessity for surgical intervention, and case outcome were collected. Summary descriptive data for each species are reported.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine VTCs in North America, Europe, and Australia contributed information from 17,335 dog and 3,425 cat trauma cases during the 42-month reporting period. A large majority of cases presented directly to the VTC after injury (80.4% dogs and 78.1% cats). Blunt trauma was the most common source for injury in cats (56.7%); penetrating trauma was the most common source for injury in dogs (52.3%). Note that 43.8% of dogs and 36.2% of cats were reported to have surgery performed. The proportion surviving to discharge was 92.0% (dogs) and 82.5% (cats).CONCLUSIONS: The VetCOT registry proved to be a powerful resource for collection of a large dataset on trauma in dogs and cats seen at VTCs. While overall survival to discharge was quite high, further evaluation of data on subsets of injury types, patient assessment parameters, interventions, and associated outcome are warranted.",

She had a nonrevealing neurology workup and a largely normal rheumatology workup apart from mild elevation in her inflammatory markers. She also had a nonfocal examination apart from a posterior cervical lymph node (2 ? 1 cm). Given that she was well appearing, with a nonfocal examination and only mild laboratory abnormalities, she was told to follow-up with rheumatology in 3 months. Around that time, she re-presented to her medical home for a well-child visit, during which she was noted to have continued weight loss, now amounting to 17 lb in 1 year, and marked further elevation in her inflammatory markers. Her laboratory results were also significant for a profound microcytic anemia requiring inpatient admission for blood transfusion. During her admission, she was seen by the rheumatology, gastroenterology, and oncology subspecialty teams. Despite imaging studies and extensive laboratory workup, there was no unifying diagnosis at the time of her hospital discharge. Ultimately, an outpatient imaging study revealed the etiology.",

We report three cases of ophthalmic surgery-induced trigeminal neuralgia.CASE PRESENTATION: Trigeminal neuralgia was diagnosed in three patients after ophthalmic surgery. Patient 1 was a 63-year-old Caucasian man with an epiretinal membrane and cataract in his left eye. Phacovitrectomy was performed. Patient 2 was a 38-year-old Caucasian man with a perforating wound in his right eye. Primary closure of the cornea with removal of the necrotic iris was performed. Patient 3 was a 52-year-old Caucasian man referred 15 days after suffering blunt trauma to his right eye. Vitrectomy was performed to remove the crystalline lens, which was luxated to the vitreous. On postoperative days, these three patients were admitted to an emergency ward due to sudden, shock-like, one-sided facial pain activated by numerous stimuli. After consultation with specialists from the anesthesia and neurology departments, a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was made. This diagnosis was based on the presence of four of the nine clinical criteria described by the International Headache Society, which were met in these three cases.CONCLUSIONS: Trigeminal neuralgia is a rare cause of postoperative ophthalmic pain and is a challenging diagnosis for the ophthalmologist. It is necessary to consider the differential diagnosis of atypical pain after ophthalmic surgery.",

It comprised patients who had experienced first-episode acute stroke. Psychological assessment was performed at day 7, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after stroke. Post-stroke depression patients were characterised by clinical response to anti-depressive pharmacological treatment measured by intra-individual changes based on the 17-item Hamilton rating scale for depression scores.RESULTS: Of the total 292 patients, 11(3.76%) were lost during 6-month follow-up. Our final analysis comprised 106(36.3%) post-stroke depression patients and 175(59.93%) post-stroke depression-free patients. The 677T allele and 677C/T genotype of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene 677C>T polymorphism, which were over-represented in depression patients and were respectively associated with 1.82-fold (p=0.001) and 3.65-fold (p<0.001) increased risk of post-stroke depression relative to the 677C allele and 677C/C genotype. No significant association was observed between this polymorphism and treatment response (p>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Mutation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene 677C>T polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with the increased risk of post-stroke depression, but not with treatment response..",

This study included only patients who had been genotyped for the MTHFR C677T polymorphism. An evaluation of homocysteine serum levels was necessary to exclude other types of migraine.CONCLUSION: Compared with the wild-type genotype, the T/T genotype was associated with an increased risk of any type of migraine, though the statistical significance was greatest in migraine with aura. The homocysteine serum levels were significantly higher in migraine with aura compared to migraine without aura. In a pediatric population MTHFR T/T homozygosity influences susceptibility to migraine.",

The IMCC incorporates geriatric nursing, social work, and APRNs from neurology, gerontology, palliative care, and geriatric psychiatry. APRNs provide comprehensive, coordinated primary care for dementia, other chronic conditions, and minor acute illnesses. Partnering with PLWD and families and taking a palliative-oriented, dementia-informed medical home approach, the IMCC aims to reduce dementia burden. This study describes the first 12 months of IMCC's operation with 139 enrolled PLWD-caregiver dyads. All patients have a diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment; most have Alzheimer's disease (53.2%). Patients have an average of 5.8 medical conditions and 6.9 prescriptions; 38.1% have an advanced directive, a medical power of attorney, or a living will. Mean age is 78.6, 63.3% are female, and 30.9% are African American. Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment score is 12.6. Most require assistance in activities of daily living. Many display neuropsychiatric symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression. The rate of ambulatory-sensitive hospitalizations declined from 6.7% in December 2015 to less than 1% in May 2016. Caregivers were highly satisfied. We observed nonsignificant improvements in neuropsychiatric symptom severity (p=.07), caregiver distress (p=.69), and caregiver competence (p=.18). IMCC is a novel care model for PLWD and their caregivers and may be a more sustainable model than traditional primary care for this growing vulnerable population.

During the first 24 months of study, improvement of seizure severity and frequency was most frequent in patients on treatment with pregabalin and levetiracetam and rarest in those on treatment with oxcarbazepine. The retention rate of patients on pregabalin and tiagabine was significantly lower compared to the retention rate of patients on most of the other antiepileptic drugs. The frequency of adverse events was higher in patients on treatment with tiagabine and pregabalin.CONCLUSION: Despite some similar characteristics of newer-generation antiepileptic drugs' effectiveness, levetiracetam stands out with better dynamic improvement of seizure severity and frequency and satisfactory tolerability; typical for pregabalin is a very good dynamic improvement of seizure severity and frequency mainly in patients with focal seizures, but a lower tolerability, and the main advantage of oxcarbazepine is a good tolerability, efficacy, however, is less satisfactory.",

Thymectomy has been established as an effective therapy for MG, as it attenuates the natural course of the disease and may result in complete remission.PATIENT CONCERNS: We report the case of a 22-year-old female with a 6-year history of MG presented with bilateral ptosis, diplopia, and intermittent dysphagia. She denied shortness of breath, dysarthria, and fatigue.DIAGNOSES: She had been diagnosed with MG 6 years previously at the Neurology Department of our hospital. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed thymic hyperplasia INTERVENTIONS:: She was treated with modified unilateral VATET that minimized incision size.OUTCOMES: Unilateral VATET was performed using two 5-mm incisions to minimize pressure on intercostal soft tissues/nerves and reduce postoperative pain.LESSONS: The lesson learnt from this case report is that this modified VATET method could be a useful approach to the management of non-thymomatous MG. The ability to achieve complete dissection with good cosmetic results may lead to wider acceptance of this technique by patients with MG and their neurologists for earlier thymectomy and improved outcomes. Additional studies are needed to determine the superiority of this approach to established methods.",

      "abstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To use the electronic medical record (EMR) to optimize patient care, facilitate documentation, and support quality improvement and practice-based research, in a headache specialty clinic.BACKGROUND: Many physicians enter data into the EMR as unstructured free text and not as discrete data. This makes it challenging to use data for quality improvement or research initiatives.METHODS: We describe the process of building a customized structured clinical documentation support toolkit, specific for patients seen in a headache specialty clinic. The content was developed through frequent physician meetings to reach consensus on elements that define clinical Best Practices. Tasks were assigned to the care team and data mapped to the progress note.RESULTS: The toolkit collects hundreds of fields of discrete, standardized data. Auto scored and interpreted score tests include the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item, Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale, Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire, Insomnia Sleep Index, and Migraine-Specific Quality of Life. We have developed Best Practice Advisories (BPA) and other clinical documentation support tools that alert physicians, when appropriate. As of April 1, 2018, we have used the toolkits at 4346 initial patient visits. We provide screenshots of our toolkits, details of data fields collected, and diagnoses of patients at the initial visit.CONCLUSIONS: The EMR can be used to effectively structure and standardize headache clinic visits for quality improvement and practice-based research. We are sharing our proprietary toolkit with other clinics as part of the Neurology Practice-Based Research Network. These tools are also facilitating clinical research enrollment and a pragmatic trial of comparative effectiveness at the point-of-care among migraine patients.",

SCI risk factors include low hemoglobin and elevated systolic blood pressure; however, mechanisms underlying their development are unclear. Using the largest prospective study evaluating SCIs in pediatric SCA, we identified brain regions with increased SCI density. We tested the hypothesis that infarct density is greatest within regions in which cerebral blood flow is lowest, further restricting cerebral oxygen delivery in the setting of chronic anemia. Neuroradiology and neurology committees reached a consensus of SCIs in 286 children in the Silent Infarct Transfusion (SIT) Trial. Each infarct was outlined and coregistered to a brain atlas to create an infarct density map. To evaluate cerebral blood flow as a function of infarct density, pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling was performed in an independent pediatric SCA cohort. Blood flow maps were aligned to the SIT Trial infarct density map. Mean blood flow within low, moderate, and high infarct density regions from the SIT Trial were compared. Logistic regression evaluated clinical and imaging predictors of overt stroke at 3-year follow-up. The SIT Trial infarct density map revealed increased SCI density in the deep white matter of the frontal and parietal lobes. A relatively small region, measuring 5.6% of brain volume, encompassed SCIs from 90% of children. Cerebral blood flow was lowest in the region of highest infarct density (P < .001). Baseline infarct volume and reticulocyte count predicted overt stroke. In pediatric SCA, SCIs are symmetrically located in the deep white matter where minimum cerebral blood flow occurs.",

Study selection consisted of randomized trials comparing droxidopa or midodrine with placebo and reporting on changes in sSBP and supine hypertension events. Data were pooled to perform a comparison among interventions in a Bayesian fixed-effects model using vague priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling, calculating pooled mean changes in sSBP and risk ratios (RRs) for supine hypertension with associated 95% credible intervals (CrIs).RESULTS: Six studies (4 administering droxidopa and 2 administering midodrine) enrolling a total of 783 patients were included for analysis. The mean change from baseline in sSBP was significantly greater for both drugs when compared with placebo (droxidopa 6.2 mm Hg [95% CrI = 2.4-10] and midodrine 17 mm Hg [95% CrI = 11.4-23]). Comparative analysis revealed a significant credible difference between droxidopa and midodrine. The RR for supine hypertension was significantly greater for midodrine, but not droxidopa, when compared with placebo (droxidopa RR = 1.4 [95% CrI = 0.7-2.7] and midodrine RR = 5.1 [95% CrI = 1.6-24]). Conclusion and Relevance: In patients with NOH, both droxidopa and midodrine significantly increase sSBP, the latter to a greater extent. However, midodrine, but not droxidopa, significantly increases risk of supine hypertension.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Reducing intrathoracic pressure in the setting of compromised cerebral perfusion due to acute brain injury has been associated with reduced intracranial pressure and enhanced cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow in animals. Noninvasive active intrathoracic pressure regulation lowers intrathoracic pressure, increases preload, reduces the volume of venous blood and cerebral spinal fluid in the skull, and enhances cerebral blood flow. We examined the feasibility of active intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy in patients with brain injury. We hypothesized that active intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy would be associated with lowered intracranial pressure and increased cerebral perfusion pressure in these patients.METHODS: At three institutions, active intrathoracic pressure regulation therapy (CirQlator, ZOLL) was utilized for 2 consecutive hours in five mechanically ventilated patients with brain injury. A 30-minute interval was used to collect baseline data and determine persistence of effects after device use. End-tidal carbon dioxide was controlled by respiratory rate changes during device use. The intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure were recorded at 5-minute intervals throughout all three periods of the protocol. Results for each interval are reported as mean and standard deviation.RESULTS: Intracranial pressure was decreased in all five patients by an average of 21% during (15 ± 4 mmHg) compared to before active intrathoracic pressure regulation (19 ± 4) (p = 0.005). This effect on intracranial pressure (15 ± 6) was still present in four of the five patients 30 minutes after therapy was discontinued (p = 0.89). As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure was 16% higher during (81 ± 10) compared to before active intrathoracic pressure regulation (70 ± 14) (p = 0.04) and this effect remained present 30 minutes after therapy was discontinued. No adverse events were reported.CONCLUSIONS: These data support the notion that active intrathoracic pressure regulation, in this limited evaluation, can successfully augment cerebral perfusion by lowering intracranial pressure and increasing mean arterial pressure in patients with mild brain injury. The measured effects were immediate on administration of the therapy and persisted to some degree after the therapy was terminated.",

Recent data suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to ALS etiology and progression. This review aims to explore evidence of associations between gut microbiota and ALS etiology and pathophysiology. Databases were searched for publications relevant to the gut microbiome in ALS. Three publications provided primary evidence of changes in microbiome profiles in ALS. An ALS mouse model revealed damaged tight junction structure and increased permeability in the intestine versus controls along with a shifted microbiome profile, including decreased levels of butyrate-producing bacteria. In a subsequent publication, again using an ALS mouse model, researchers showed that dietary supplementation with butyrate relieved symptoms and lengthened both time to onset of weight loss and survival time. In a small study of ALS patients and healthy controls, investigators also found decreased levels of butyrate-producing bacteria. Essential for maintaining gut barrier integrity, butyrate is the preferred energy source of intestinal epithelial cells. Ten other articles were reviews and commentaries providing indirect support for a role of gut microbiota in ALS pathophysiology. Thus, these studies provide a modicum of evidence implicating gut microbiota in ALS disease, although more research is needed to confirm the connection and determine pathophysiologic mechanisms. Nurses caring for these patients need to understand the gut microbiome and its potential role in ALS in order to effectively counsel patients and their families about emerging therapies (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbial transplant) and their off-label uses.",

It optimizes the benefit of antiparkinsonian treatment by counteracting the negative effect of erratic gastric emptying on the absorption of oral levodopa. The purpose is to describe our outpatient protocol of treatment establishment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our unit we have implemented a protocol for the treatment with intradoudenal levodopa-carbidopa infusion without admission based on the development of a multidisciplinary circuit among the Neurology Service, the Digestive Endoscopy Unit and the Home Hospitalization Unit.RESULTS: Over one and a half year, we treated five patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. All of them remain on the medication and no significant side effect has taken place.CONCLUSION: The outpatient onset install of this treatment saves costs and avoids the negative impact of admission on the patient with advanced Parkinson's disease, in the same way that favors their adaptation and tolerability to it.",

Patients ranged in age from 2 to 88 years. Analysis was focused on 441 curated genes associated with ataxia and ataxia-like conditions.RESULTS: Pathogenic and suspected diagnostic variants were identified in 88 of the 170 patients, providing a positive molecular diagnostic rate of 52%. Forty-six different genes were implicated, with the six most commonly mutated genes being SPG7, SYNE1, ADCK3, CACNA1A, ATP1A3, and SPTBN2, which accounted for >40% of the positive cases. In many cases a diagnosis was provided for conditions that were not suspected and resulted in the broadening of the clinical spectrum of several conditions.CONCLUSION: Exome sequencing with targeted analysis provides a high-yield approach for the genetic diagnosis of ataxia-related conditions. This is the largest targeted exome study performed to date in patients with ataxia and ataxia-like conditions and represents patients with a wide range of ataxia phenotypes typically encountered in neurology and genetics clinics.",

It is unclear how adherence to one medication predicts adherence to others. A predictive relationship could permit less expensive adherence monitoring if overall adherence could be predicted through tracking a single medication.METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we examined whether patients with multiple mental and physical illnesses have similar adherence trajectories across medications. Specifically, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using health insurance claims data for enrollees who were diagnosed with a serious mental illness, initiated an atypical antipsychotic, as well as an SSRI (to treat serious mental illness), biguanides (to treat type 2 diabetes), or an ACE inhibitor (to treat hypertension). Using group-based trajectory modeling, we estimated adherence patterns based on monthly estimates of the proportion of days covered with each medication. We measured the predictive value of the atypical antipsychotic trajectories to adherence predictions based on patient characteristics and assessed their relative strength with the R-squared goodness of fit metric.RESULTS: Within our sample of 431,591 patients, four trajectory groups were observed: non-adherent, gradual discontinuation, stop-start, and adherent. The accuracy of atypical antipsychotic adherence for predicting adherence to ACE inhibitors, biguanides, and SSRIs was 44.5, 44.5, and 49.6%, respectively (all p < 0.001 vs. random). We also found that information on patient adherence patterns to atypical antipsychotics was a better predictor of patient adherence to these three medications than would be the case using patient demographic and clinical characteristics alone.CONCLUSION: Among patients with multiple chronic mental and physical illnesses, patterns of atypical antipsychotic adherence were useful predictors of adherence patterns to a patient's adherence to ACE inhibitors, biguanides, and SSRIs.FUNDING: Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc.",

However, neurotoxicity has been reported with the use of metronidazole but rather rare. The most common neurological manifestation is peripheral neuropathy involvement in the form of sensory loss. It is worth mentioning that central neurotoxicity is a rare side effect of metronidazole use but reversible. The manifestations vary from a headache, altered mental status to focal neurological deficits. The diagnosis is mainly by neuroimaging in the setting of acute neurological change in the patient status. Here, we report a case of metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity in a 38-year-old male patient who was admitted with a brain abscess and was started on metronidazole for more than 10 weeks.",

The study included data on 859 patients with the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumor. Diagnosis was based on the routine CNS neuroimaging methods (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging). Access to patient medical records provided demographic and clinical data, continued by collection of data on potential lethal outcome of patients at the Registrar's Office. The study was conducted at the Department of Neurology, Split University Hospital Centre, from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. There were 448 male and 411 female patients. Median age at the diagnosis was 65 (range, 18-95) years. Primary CNS tumors were diagnosed in 527 patients, including 30 primary recurrent tumors, whereas 328 patients had metastatic tumors; in 4 cases, it was impossible to determine whether the tumor was a primary one or metastasis based on CNS neuroimaging. The primary tumors proved to be more common than the metastatic ones (÷2-test, p<0.05). Multiple tumor transplants were more common than solitary (211 vs. 117; the conclusion was made at a 95% level of confidence; ÷2-test, p<0.05). The majority of metastases originated from the lung (bronchus and pleura cancer; 46.41%; ÷2-test, p<0.05; 95% CI). The most common localization of CNS tumors was supratentorial. Based on the double-logarithmic model, we proved with statistical significance that there was an increase in the incidence of CNS tumors (p=0.001). The most common tumors studied were supratentorially localized meningiomas.",

We, therefore, report the neurological spectrum, triggering factors and outcome of HHS in general neurology practice.Methods: The records of the patients with HHS were extracted from computerized hospital information system and those managed currently were prospectively included. The demographic, clinical manifestations, duration of diabetes and precipitating events such as infection, stress and stroke were noted. Patients with HHS were categorized into seizure, movement disorder and encephalopathy groups. Their electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and outcome were noted.Results: There were 17 patients with HHS (age range 40 and 75 yr) and seven were females. Seven patients were diabetic for five years, one for four years, one for one year and four were diagnosed after the occurrence of HHS. Four patients had epilepsia partialis continua persisting for 72-360 h, one patient had focal seizures and his MRI revealed T2 hyperintensity in frontal region in one patient and cerebellar vermian hyperintensity in another. All the five patients improved, but two had neurological deficits on discharge. Nine patients had encephalopathy which was precipitated by stroke in six patients, urinary infections in two and meningitis in one. Three females had hemichorea-hemiballismus syndrome, which was triggered by infections. Abnormal movements lasted 5-10 days and responded to correction of hyperosmolarity. Nine out of 17 patients improved completely whereas the remaining eight had partial recovery, these patients had stroke, ventilator-related complications or meningoencephalitis.Interpretation & conclusions: The most common presentation of HHS was encephalopathy (9) followed by seizure (5) and hemichorea-hemiballismus syndrome (3) which responded to the correction of hyperosmolar state.",

The purpose of this work is to investigate the related factors of OA in patients with acute ischemic stroke after the administration of intravenous thrombolytic therapy, to improve the predictive ability of OA during intravenous thrombolytic therapy, and to reduce the prevalence of complications.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 1223 cases of patients with acute ischemic stroke that were treated in the Department of Neurology No. 4 of the Tianjin Huanhu Hospital from June 2014 to April 2015. The clinical manifestations of rt-PA related OA were recorded, the clinical prevalence was counted, related factors of OA after intravenous thrombolytic therapy were analyzed, and the risk assessment of rt-PA related OA was conducted.RESULTS: 14 cases of patients developed OA, with a prevalence rate of 1.14%. Among them, 5 had a history of urticaria, 4 of drug allergy, and 3 of food allergy. Among the 14 cases of patients, 10 developed OA in the process of intravenous thrombolysis and 4 after intravenous thrombolysis, 12 showed lip edema, 9 showed extensive swelling of tongue, 3 showed swelling of lateral tongue, 3 were complicated by respiratory distress, 10 showed infarction in the middle cerebral artery territory, and 6 had previously been given oral ACEI drugs.CONCLUSIONS: Orolingual angioedema is a rare complication that occurs after rt-PA intravenous thrombolytic therapy; when serious, it may endanger a patient's life. If patients take an oral hypotension such as ACEI drugs before the onset of OA, they have a history of allergies, or the lesion is an infraction in the dominated area of the middle cerebral artery, the risk of OA after rt-PA intravenous thrombolytic therapy will be increased. The prevalence of OA should be monitored during the rt-PA intravenous thrombolytic therapy process; timely detection and early intervention should be conducted, which can avoid serious adverse consequences.",

As expected, CYP2D6*1 allele (wild type) frequency was significantly greater than CYP2D6*DUP, CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*10 alleles in both chronically tramadol-treated and control groups. In tramadol-treated patients, CYP2D6*DUP allele carriers followed by those carrying CYP2D6*1, displayed higher levels of urinary tramadol major active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1) and serum lipid peroxidation along with lower levels of total antioxidants than those carrying other impaired function alleles (CYP2D6*4&*10), suggesting oxidative stress. There were also significant increases in serum hepatic damage markers including alpha-glutathione transferase (á-GST) levels and liver function enzyme activities in *DUP and *1 carriers compared to carriers of other alleles. Moreover, we reported that in 42 patients with allele *1, tramadol caused mild to moderate hepatotoxicity (grades: 1-2) within 13-16 months while in 7 patients with duplicated allele (*DUP), tramadol caused moderate to severe hepatotoxicity (grades: 2-3) within 10-11 months (moderately longer period but shorter than that observed in allele *1), implying that exposure to tramadol for longer time in extensive and ultra-rapid metabolizers may contribute to hepatotoxicity development. Overall, our results suggest that CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms, particularly enhanced or normal function of CYP2D6, may increase the vulnerability to long term tramadol-induced hepatotoxicity through the enhancement of accumulation of tramadol bioactive metabolite (M1) and hence oxidative stress. Therefore, tramadol doses should be adjusted according to patient's CYP2D6 genotyping analysis to avoid hepatotoxicity.",

Little is known about such ratings in Canada.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the scope and trends for specialty, geographic region, and time for online physician ratings in Canada using a national data source from the country's leading physician-rating website.METHODS: This observational retrospective study used online ratings data from Canadian physicians (January 2005-September 2013; N=640,603). For specialty, province, and year of rating, we assessed whether physicians were likely to be rated favorably by using the proportion of ratings greater than the overall median rating.RESULTS: In total, 57,412 unique physicians had 640,603 individual ratings. Overall, ratings were positive (mean 3.9, SD 1.3). On average, each physician had 11.2 (SD 10.1) ratings. By comparing specialties with Canadian Institute of Health Information physician population numbers over our study period, we inferred that certain specialties (obstetrics and gynecology, family practice, surgery, and dermatology) were more commonly rated, whereas others (pathology, radiology, genetics, and anesthesia) were less represented. Ratings varied by specialty; cardiac surgery, nephrology, genetics, and radiology were more likely to be rated in the top 50th percentile, whereas addiction medicine, dermatology, neurology, and psychiatry were more often rated in the lower 50th percentile of ratings. Regarding geographic practice location, ratings were more likely to be favorable for physicians practicing in eastern provinces compared with western and central Canada. Regarding year, the absolute number of ratings peaked in 2007 before stabilizing and decreasing by 2013. Moreover, ratings were most likely to be positive in 2007 and again in 2013.CONCLUSIONS: Physician-rating websites are a relatively novel source of provider-level patient satisfaction and are a valuable source of the patient experience. It is important to understand the breadth and scope of such ratings, particularly regarding specialty, geographic practice location, and changes over time.",

To prospectively assess disability progression of multiple sclerosis in Tunisia. Analysis was performed in 600 patients from the MS database of the Mongi Ben Hmida National Institute of Neurology (Tunis, Tunisia), prospectively recorded over a 10-year period. Two MS phases were defined: phase 1, from MS clinical onset to Disability Status Scale (DSS) 3; and phase 2, from DSS 3 to DSS 6. Median durations of both phases and median ages at DSS 3 and DSS 6 were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median ages at DSS scores 3 and 6 were 48 years (95% confidence interval (CI), 45-50) and 53 years (95% CI, 52-55), respectively. Median time from onset to DSS 3 (phase 1 duration) was 9 years (95% CI, 7-11) and median time to DSS 6 was 12 years (95% CI, 10-15). Median phase 2 duration was 3 years (95% CI, 2.4-3.6). Males and progressive-onset patients had faster disability worsening during the first phase of the disease. Conversely, disability progression during the second phase was independent of gender and MS phenotype at onset. Our study showed that disability progression followed a two-stage process in Tunisian MS patients with however a more aggressive course compared to that in Westerners.",

To involve a referent nurse and a caregiver from the patient's social circle in nurse-led multimodal and long-term management of risk factors after stroke could be an advantage due to their easier access to the patient and family. The aim of this study is to compare the benefit of optimized follow up by nursing personnel from the vascular neurology department including therapeutic follow up, and an interventional program directed to the patient and a caregiving member of their social circle, as compared with typical follow up in order to develop a specific follow-up program of secondary prevention of stroke.METHODS/DESIGN: The design is a randomized, controlled, clinical trial conducted in the French Stroke Unit of the Strokavenir network. In total, 410 patients will be recruited and randomized in optimized follow up or usual follow up for 2 years. In both group, patients will be seen by a neurologist at 6, 12 and 24 months. The optimized follow up will include follow up by a nurse from the vascular neurology department, including therapeutic follow up, and a training program on secondary prevention directed to the patient and a caregiving member of their social circle. After discharge, a monthly telephone interview, in the first year and every 3 months in the second year, will be performed by the nurse. At 6, 12 and 24 month, the nurse will give the patient and caregiver another training session. Usual follow up is only done by the patient's general practitioner, after classical information on secondary prevention of risk factors during hospitalization. The primary outcome measure is blood pressure measured after the first year of follow up. Blood pressure will be measured by nursing personnel who do not know the group into which the patient has been randomized. Secondary endpoints are associated mortality, morbidity, recurrence, drug side-effects and medico-economic analysis.DISCUSSION: The result of this trial is expected to provide the benefit of a nurse-led optimized multimodal and long-term interventional program for management of risk factors after stroke, personalizing the role of the nurse and including the patient's caregiver.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 02132364.

The study aimed to investigate the presence of some cardiovascular risk factors - dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension - in PD patients and to compare their risk with non-PD population in South East Hungary.Methods: A case-control study was conducted at the Department of Neurology, University of Szeged, Hungary. The study included 1299 subjects out of which 620 patients were identified as cases of diagnosed PD and 679 as controls. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to reveal the association of vascular risk factors with PD.Results: In the univariate analysis, diabetes mellitus was positively associated with PD, while dyslipidemia showed negative association to it in the total population, and no significant associations were found between hypertension and PD. The multivariate logistic regression models showed that the odds of diabetes mellitus was higher (OR=2.86), while the odds of dyslipidemia was lower (OR=0.58) among PD patients than in the control group. Hypertension showed a different pattern by gender: the odds of registered hypertension was significantly lower in female PD patients (OR=0.68), whereas the result was not significant in males.Conclusion: This is the first study that provides a comprehensive view of the cardiovascular risk factors in PD patients in Hungary and shows considerable relationship between diabetes mellitus and PD.",

For patients with ataxia of mixed etiology, riluzole probably improves ataxia signs at 8 weeks (1 Class I study). For patients with Friedreich ataxia or spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), riluzole probably improves ataxia signs at 12 months (1 Class I study). For patients with SCA type 3, valproic acid 1,200 mg/d possibly improves ataxia at 12 weeks. For patients with spinocerebellar degeneration, thyrotropin-releasing hormone possibly improves some ataxia signs over 10 to 14 days (1 Class II study). For patients with SCA type 3 who are ambulatory, lithium probably does not improve signs of ataxia over 48 weeks (1 Class I study). For patients with Friedreich ataxia, deferiprone possibly worsens ataxia signs over 6 months (1 Class II study). Data are insufficient to support or refute the use of numerous agents. For nonpharmacologic options, in patients with degenerative ataxias, 4-week inpatient rehabilitation probably improves ataxia and function (1 Class I study); transcranial magnetic stimulation possibly improves cerebellar motor signs at 21 days (1 Class II study). For patients with multiple sclerosis-associated ataxia, the addition of pressure splints possibly has no additional benefit compared with neuromuscular rehabilitation alone (1 Class II study). Data are insufficient to support or refute use of stochastic whole-body vibration therapy (1 Class III study).",

These MS related falls hamper the day to day living of these individuals and are one of the prime factors aggravating the disease related morbidity. The fear of falling itself may make these individuals more dependent and hinder their professional and leisurely activities. Hence, the significance of identifying individuals who are at risk of falling and instituting preventive counter-measures cannot be overemphasized. Various simple clinical tests and questionnaires have been recommended for this purpose, but are far from ideal.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to find accurate measures to predict a future fall in MS patients. We also aimed to enquire about the prevalence of falls in MS population and its clinical profile which included detailed history about the past falls, Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores, Timed 25 foot walk (T25FW) scores, Activities specific balance confidence (ABC) scores, Falls efficacy scale international (FESI) scores, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale 12 (MSWS12) questionnaire.DESIGN/METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted at the Institute of Neurology, Chennai from January 2015 to August 2017. MS patients of any subtype attending Neurology OPD satisfying revised 2010 McDonald criteria were recruited. 134 subjects with MS consented to participate in this study and 113 of them who met the criteria were included. Baseline history was obtained about the number of falls in the previous year. EDSS, T25FW, ABC, FESI, and MSWS12 scores were obtained at the baseline. VEMP and SEP tests were done and the baseline P13/N23 cVEMP latencies, N10 oVEMP latency, and P37 lower limb SEP latency were obtained. These subjects were followed up for one year and were enquired if they had fallen during that period and the number of falls was recorded. Logistic regression models were used to compute the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each variable tested. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each variable with the number of future falls.RESULTS: Among the 113 patients, 72% (n = 81) had one or more falls during follow-up. Among all variables tested P13 cervical VEMP latency had the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.820) followed by N10 ocular VEMP latency (AUC = 0.794) and P37 SEP latency (AUC = 0.732). P13 latency also had the highest correlation coefficient (R = 0.689, R2 = 0.475) with the number of future falls.CONCLUSION: P13, N10 and P37 latencies were the most accurate in predicting a future fall when compared to clinical measures.",

Methods: We confirmed the etiological diagnosis of 137 hospitalized ophthalmoplegia patients with cavernous sinus lesion retrospectively from January 2005 to January 2014 in the Department of Neurology of Beijing Tongren Hospital.The diagnosis was made according to clinical feature, laboratory test, imaging studies and pathology.The clinical data of these patients were analyzed and compared among different groups. Results: Fifty-one cases (37.2%) were confirmed as inflammatory diseases of cavernous sinus, which were the most common cause in 137 patients.Early stage pain (OR 5.591, 95%CI 1.703-18.401) and involvement of oculomotor nerve (OR 4.902, 95%CI 1.015-24.630) were independently associated with inflammatory diseases.Forty-three cases (31.3%) were confirmed to have tumor, which was the second cause of cavernous sinus lesions, and meningioma was the most common tumor.The second branch of trigeminal nerve involvement was independently correlated (OR 1.017, 95%CI 1.005-1.071) with tumor.The percentage of male (OR 3.506, 95%CI 1.362-8.765) was significantly higher in 28 cases (20.4%) with cavernous sinus vascular lesions.Cavernous sinus infectious diseases were seen in 15 cases (10.9%), and fungal infection was the most common, mostly secondary to sinus infection. Conclusions: The common causes of cavernous sinus lesion include cavernous sinus inflammatory diseases, neoplastic diseases, vascular diseases and infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases is the most commonly seen cause in this group of patients.Obvious facial sensory disturbances and the second branch of trigeminal nerve involvement are independent associated with tumor.The early course of pain and involvement of oculomotor nerve are associated with inflammatory diseases.Optimization of MRI examination method can better identify the cavernous sinus lesions.",

These episodes were separated by month-long asymptomatic intervals. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis, which was clinically quiescent on leflunomide.Repeated cerebrospinal fluid examination showed a persistent lymphocytosis with mildly reduced glucose and elevated protein; oligoclonal bands and viral PCR were negative. MRI of the brain was initially normal, but 7 months after initial presentation revealed meningeal enhancement with bifrontal cortical hyperintensities on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. Brain biopsy demonstrated necrotising granulomatous meningitis with mixed T cell and B cell infiltrates and without evidence of vasculitis or infection. Serum anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were strongly positive.The diagnosis of rheumatoid meningoencephalitis was made on the basis of brain biopsy findings and serological evidence of active rheumatoid disease. Steroids and rituximab therapy were started leading to clinical stabilisation.",

CSF PCR for herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus was negative. He developed acute right haemiplegia a week after hospitalisation. MRI showed acute infarct in the left centrum semiovale. His angiogram showed aneurysm in the left subclavian artery and aortic arch. The mycoplasma antibody test came positive with very high titres, while rest of the workup was negative. He was treated with azithromycin and his symptoms improved completely.He was asymptomatic on follow-up after a month. His repeat immunoglobulin G mycoplasma antibody titre showed elevation.

To improve stroke management, we examined the motor disability of patients presenting with stroke, their course, and its determinant factors. This retrospective descriptive study reviewed case records from the neurology unit of the Befelatanana University Hospital from january to december 2015. We included all patients who had a stroke with motor impairment of any upper or lower limbs, with or without computed tomography of the brain, that is, 227 (36.50 %) of the 622 patients admitted to the neurology unit. The mean age of onset was 55.41 years with a sex-ratio 1.16. Predominantly, we found perforating artery strokes (51.54 %), ischemic strokes (36.12 %), and right limb location deficits (50.22 %). Stroke patients were managed with physical therapy from the beginning of the acute stage, that is, from the admission (77.53 %). Two third of the motor deficits were steady (67.84 %), with a median NIHSS=8 and MRS=4 at hospital discharge. The mortality rate was 8.37 % (6.60 % during the first week and 1.77 % after that). We found no significant determinant factors. Hospital mortality decreased during the study. The lack of overcoming of motor disability was due to the short follow-up period, which included only the acute stage. These findings point out the utility of a neurovascular unit (UNV) for reducing disabilities and developing a network for stroke management during the acute stage in Madagascar.",

In the early stages of the disease, especially in younger patients with milder symptoms, the introduction of levodopa substitution could be efficacious in delaying; in advanced stages they are mainly used to treat motor complications, as an adjunct to levodopa.AIM: The evaluation of therapeutical strategies used in the neurology clinics of Tirgu Mures County Emergency Clinical Hospital in order to define the role of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.METHOD: This retrospective study includes all records of patients with Parkinson's disease hospitalized between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2016. From the 2194 reports we used data focusing on the therapeutic recommendations. Regarding disease duration, we divided the patients in two groups: less than or equal to 5 years and more than 5 years.RESULTS: From the 1183 patients in first group, 243 received monoamine oxidase inhibitors: 12 as monotherapy, 52 together with dopamine agonists, in 61 cases combined with levodopa. In 118 cases monoamine oxidase inhibitors were combined with levodopa and dopamine agonists. From 582 cases whith Parkinson's disease for more than 5 years, 195 received monoamine oxidase B inhibitors (selegiline: 10 cases, rasagiline: 185 cases). In 429 cases we did not find accurate data regarding disease duration (selegiline: 5 cases, rasagiline: 93 cases).CONCLUSION: The use of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors was similar to those found in literature. The treating physicians should utilise more confidently the available therapeutical combinations. Orv Hetil. 2017; 158(51): 2023-2028.",

He also described the symptoms of inherited neurodegenerative spinocerebellar ataxia involving the olivary nucleus (Gordon-Holmes syndrome). Independently from the Australian neurologist William John Adie (1886-1935), he described the partial iridoplegia (Holmes-Adie pupil or Holmes-Adie syndrome).

Design and administer one electronic survey to accredited pharmacy programs asking them to report information on curricula in psychiatry and neurology for the 2014-2015 academic year. Design and administer a separate electronic survey to board certified pharmacists with an academic affiliation who are members of the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists (CPNP) asking about their teaching activities and their opinion on optimal curricula. Results. Fifty-six percent of pharmacy programs and 65% of CPNP members responded to the surveys. The program survey revealed greater than 80% of topics were taught by full-time faculty. Didactic lecturing, team-based learning, and case studies were the most common teaching methods. Programs dedicated the most didactics (3 to 5+ hours) to epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, and pain. Autism, traumatic brain injury, personality, and eating disorders were either not taught or given ? 1 hour of didactics in most programs. Inpatient psychiatry had the most APPE placements with a mean of 19.6, range 0-83. APPE electives in psychiatry outnumbered those in neurology 5 to 1. CPNP member survey results showed 2 out of 3 members agreed that curriculum could be improved with additional APPEs in psychiatry and neurology. Conclusion. Didactic hour distribution in psychiatry and neurology could be improved to better align with board certification in psychiatric pharmacy (BCPP) recommendations and disorder prevalence and complexity. Specialists recommend an experiential component in neurology and psychiatry to combat stigma and improve pharmacist knowledge and skills.",

Abnormal vHIT was defined as angular velocity gain (peak eye velocity/peak head velocity) less than 0.79 at 80 ms and 0.75 at 60 ms, which was two standard deviations below our institutions' lower limit of normal; together with refixation saccades. Abnormal bi-thermal caloric testing defined unilateral hypofunction as a 25% difference using Jongkee's formula and bilateral hypofunction was defined by the sum of the peak slow phase velocities over the four irrigations being <20°/s. Sixty patients had abnormal results on one or both tests, of whom 51 had unilateral and nine bilateral hypofunction. With caloric testing considered as the gold standard, the sensitivity (95% CI) of the vHIT was 18/52, 34.6% (22.0-49.1), and the specificity (95% CI) was 113/121, 93.4% (87.4-97.1). However vHIT was more sensitive in the nine patients with bilateral hypofunction with 100% abnormal vHIT results while only 4/9, 44% had abnormal caloric results. In conclusion these results support the continued use of both vHIT and caloric tests in patients with sub-acute and chronic vestibular symptoms, especially if the vHIT is normal.",

We applied partial least squares discriminant analysis, weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and pathway analysis to the metabolomics data. Generalized estimating equations models were used to assess change in WGCNA-identified module scores or metabolite pathways with vitamin D supplementation.RESULTS: Utilizing multiple analytical techniques, we identified metabolic alterations in oxidative stress (ã-glutamyl amino acid, glutathione) and xenobiotic metabolism (benzoate, caffeine) in MS patients compared with healthy controls in the first cohort. In the vitamin D supplementation cohort, we identified two sets of metabolites altered differentially between MS patients and healthy controls with vitamin D supplementation. The first included markers of oxidative stress and protein oxidation (P = 0.006), while the second contained lysolipids and fatty acids (P = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: Using metabolomics, we identified alterations in oxidative stress and xenobiotic metabolism in MS patients and subsequently demonstrated a reduction of oxidative stress markers with vitamin D supplementation in healthy controls but not in MS patients. We demonstrate the utility of metabolomics in identifying aberrant metabolic processes and in monitoring the ability of therapeutic interventions to correct these abnormalities.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01667796.FUNDING: This study was supported by NIH grant K23 NS067055, grants from the Race to Erase MS, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the American Academy of Neurology, and North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis.",

      "abstractText": "The 6th annual meeting to address key issues in positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was held again in T?bingen, Germany, from March 27 to 29, 2017. Over three days of invited plenary lectures, round table discussions and dialogue board deliberations, participants critically assessed the current state of PET/MRI, both clinically and as a research tool, and attempted to chart future directions. The meeting addressed the use of PET/MRI and workflows in oncology, neurosciences, infection, inflammation and chronic pain syndromes, as well as deeper discussions about how best to characterise the tumour microenvironment, optimise the complementary information available from PET and MRI, and how advanced data mining and bioinformatics, as well as information from liquid biomarkers (circulating tumour cells and nucleic acids) and pathology, can be integrated to give a more complete characterisation of disease phenotype. Some issues that have dominated previous meetings, such as the accuracy of MR-based attenuation correction (AC) of the PET scan, were finally put to rest as having been adequately addressed for the majority of clinical situations. Likewise, the ability to standardise PET systems for use in multicentre trials was confirmed, thus removing a perceived barrier to larger clinical imaging trials. The meeting openly questioned whether PET/MRI should, in all cases, be used as a whole-body imaging modality or whether in many circumstances it would best be employed to give an in-depth study of previously identified disease in a single organ or region. The meeting concluded that there is still much work to be done in the integration of data from different fields and in developing a common language for all stakeholders involved. In addition, the participants advocated joint training and education for individuals who engage in routine PET/MRI. It was agreed that PET/MRI can enhance our understanding of normal and disrupted biology, and we are in a position to describe the in vivo nature of disease processes, metabolism, evolution of cancer and the monitoring of response to pharmacological interventions and therapies. As such, PET/MRI is a key to advancing medicine and patient care.",

Patients and families find the diagnosis of PNES difficult to understand; the transition from neurology (where the diagnosis is made) to mental health services (to which patients are referred for treatment) can be a bumpy one. This study reports how diagnostic formulations constructed for 60 consecutive children and adolescents with PNES were used to inform both the explanations about PNES that were given to them and their families and the clinical interventions that were used to help patients gain control over PNES. Families were able to accept the diagnosis of PNES and engage in treatment when it was explained how emotional distress, illness and states of high arousal could activate atypical defence responses in the body and brain - with PNES being an unwanted by-product of this process. Patients and their families made good use of therapeutic interventions. A total of 75% of children/adolescents (45/60) regained normal function and attained full-time return to school. Global Assessment of Functioning scores increased from 41 to 67 ( t(54) = 10.09; p < .001). Outcomes were less favourable in children/adolescents who presented with chronic PNES and in those with a chronic, comorbid mental health disorder that failed to resolve with treatment. The study highlights that prompt diagnosis, followed by prompt multidisciplinary assessment, engagement, and treatment, achieves improved outcomes in children/adolescents with PNES.",

In 1906, Hermann Oppenheim reported a patient with bilateral stereoagnosia (astereognosis) caused by a left parietal lobe tumor and proposed that the left hemisphere was also dominant for stereognosis. Surprisingly, few cases of bilateral stereoagnosia caused by a unilateral cerebral lesion have been documented in the literature since then. Here we report a 75-year-old right-handed man who developed bilateral stereoagnosia after suffering a small infarct in the crown of the left postcentral gyrus. He could not recognize objects with either hand, but retained the ability to localize stimuli applied to the palm of his left (ipsilesional) hand. He was severely disabled in ordinary activities requiring the use of his hands. The lesion corresponded to Brodmann area 1, where probabilistic anatomic, functional, and electrophysiologic studies have located one of the multiple somatosensory representations of the hand. The lesion was in a strategic position to interrupt both the processing of afferent tactile information issuing from the primary somatosensory cortex (areas 3a and 3b) and the forward higher-order processing in area 2, the secondary sensory cortex, and the contralateral area 1. The lesion also deprived the motor hand area of its afferent regulation from the sensory hand area (grasping), while leaving intact the visuomotor projections from the occipital cortex (reaching). Our patient supports Oppenheim's proposal that the left postcentral gyrus of some individuals is dominant for stereognosis.",

A multitude of stressors can exacerbate MG. When symptoms are exacerbated, muscle weakness can be severe enough to result in respiratory failure, a condition known as myasthenic crisis (MC).OBJECTIVE: This review discusses risk factors, diagnosis, management, and iatrogenic avoidance of MC.DISCUSSION: MC can affect any age, ethnicity, or sex and can be precipitated with any stressor, infection being the most common. MC is a clinical diagnosis defined by respiratory failure caused by exacerbation of MG. Muscle weakness can involve any voluntary muscle. MC can be differentiated from other neuromuscular junction diseases by the presence of normal reflexes, normal sensation, lack of autonomic symptoms, lack of fasciculations, and worsening weakness with repetitive motion. Treatment should target the inciting event and airway support. All acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be avoided in crisis, including edrophonium testing and corticosteroids initially. Respiratory support can begin with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, as this has been successful even in patients with bulbar weakness. If intubation is necessary, consider avoiding paralytics or use a reduced dose of nondepolarizing agents.CONCLUSIONS: MC should be in the differential of any patient with muscular weakness and respiratory compromise. Emergency department management of MC should focus on ruling out infection and respiratory support. Strong consideration should be given to beginning with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for ventilatory support. Corticosteroids, depolarizing paralytics, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should be avoided in patients with MC in the emergency department.",

Forty-seven different neurological presenting signs were reported with 79 per cent of the donated patients presenting with abnormal gait. All cases presenting with abnormalities in more than 4 out of 10 neurological categories died or were euthanased on welfare grounds. Calves were significantly more likely to present with neurological disorders than adult cattle compared with the proportion of calves: cows in the Scottish cattle population and total case population donated to SCPAHFS. Lesions were most commonly localised to the spinal cord in sheep 47 per cent (16), the peripheral nervous system in cattle 45 per cent (28) and to the brain in the overall population 41 per cent (39). The most common aetiology of neurological pathologies observed was infectious or inflammatory 28 per cent (27). Definitive diagnoses could be reached in 84 per cent (81) of patients. When postmortem reports were available, they produced a diagnosis in 70 per cent (52) of cases and contradicted clinical diagnoses in 38 per cent (26) of cases. The most frequently diagnosed conditions in ruminants over the 10 years were spastic paresis, vertebral osteomyelitis and listeriosis.",

In tertiary setting, clinical, microbiological, cytological and radiological investigations are not distinctive enough for diagnosing microbial etiology. Molecular diagnostics is filling this gap. We evaluated the clinical impact of a commercially available multiplex molecular diagnostic system - SES for diagnosing suspected CNS infections.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in our tertiary level Neurology ICU. 110 patients admitted during Nov-2010 to April-2014 were included. CSF samples of patients clinically suspected of having CNS infections were subjected to routine investigation in our laboratory and SES test at XCyton Diagnostics. We studied the impact of SES in diagnosis of CNS infections and its efficacy in helping therapeutic management.RESULTS: SES showed detection rate of 42.18% and clinical specificity of 100%. It had 10 times higher detection rate than conventional tests. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were two top bacterial pathogens. VZV was most detected viral pathogen. SES results elicited changes in therapy in both positive and negative cases. We observed superior patient outcomes as measured by GCS scale. 75% and 82.14% of the patients positive and negative on SES respectively, recovered fully.CONCLUSION: Detecting causative organism and ruling out infectious etiology remain the most critical aspect for management and prognosis of patients with suspected CNS infections. In this study, we observed higher detection rate of pathogens, target specific escalation and evidence based de-escalation of antimicrobials using SES. Institution of appropriate therapy helped reduce unnecessary use of antimicrobials.",

It predominantly affects brain regions with a high metabolic rate such as mammillary bodies, medial thalamic nuclei, the tectal region and the cerebellum. Although chronic alcoholism is the most common cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy, various other conditions not related to alcohol consumption such as bariatric surgery, acute pancreatitis, hyperemesis gravidarum, prolonged fasting and gastrointestinal surgery have been implicated in its aetiology. We report the case of a patient who underwent surgery for liver abscess and subsequently developed Wernicke's encephalopathy; he showed a positive response to thiamine supplementation. This is the first report describing liver abscess as the cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy.",

This is a case of a 65-year-old woman suffering from degenerative scoliosis and osteoporotic multiple vertebral collapses treated with posterior dorsolumbar stabilisation with screws and rods. Four months later, skin necrosis and infection appeared in the cranial wound with exposure of the rods. A surgical procedure of debridement of the infected tissue and package with a myocutaneous trapezius muscle flap was performed. One week after surgery, negative pressure wound therapy was started on the residual skin defect. The wound healed after 2 months. The aim of this case report is to focus on the utility of this method even in the case of hardware exposure and infection. This may help avoid removing instrumentation and creating instability.",

Participants were divided into two groups: EDI and no additional features (EDI-) and EDI with additional features (EDI+).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency a cause was found for the child's EDI and which tests contributed to a diagnosis.RESULTS: 699 participants, 68.8% boys, median age at investigation 2 years 8 months (range 3 months to 11 years 5 months). 61 (8.7%) of participants had no investigations, and children with EDI- were less likely to be investigated (÷2=12.5, p<0.05). A diagnosis was made in 166 children (23.7%) and was more frequent in EDI+ (EDI- 9.9%, EDI+ 27.3%, ÷2=19.0; p<0.05). Full blood count, zinc protoporphyrin, renal or liver function, bone profile, biotinidase, creatine kinase or lead level revealed no diagnoses. The following investigations found causes for EDI: MRI (23.1%), microarray (11.5%), Fragile X (0.9%), plasma amino acids (1.2%), urine organic acids (0.9%) and thyroid function tests (0.5%).CONCLUSIONS: The majority of 'screening' investigations for EDI do not contribute to a diagnosis, highlighting an area of cost saving for the NHS and reduced burden for patients and families. We propose a streamlined guideline for the investigation of EDI based on our data.",

A 51-year-old man, with liver cirrhosis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was enrolled in a research trial comparing HCC detection in FCH PET versus FDG PET. During the course of the trial, he underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for HCC. A repeat FCH PET scan post-RFA incidentally revealed a 2.5?€‰cm lesion with avid uptake in the left occipital area of the brain. The patient was asymptomatic. MRI suggested this was an abscess. A craniotomy and drainage was performed, with culture of Streptococcus intermedius (Smilleri group) from the thick-walled collection, a causative organism for previous episode of pneumonia.

In this case-control study, we asked whether these subtypes varied as a function of personality and history of childhood abuse.METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with PMD from the Human Motor Control Section Clinic at the National Institutes of Health, 43 patients with PNES from the Rhode Island Hospital Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurology Division, and 26 healthy volunteers (HC) received a battery of neurological, psychiatric and psychological assessments, including the NEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO PI-R), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ).RESULTS: One-way ANOVA between the three groups indicated significant differences in overall domains of Neuroticism (p=0.001) and Conscientiousness (p=0.009): Patients with PNES reported significantly greater levels of Neuroticism (p=0.002) and lower levels of Conscientiousness (p=0.023) than patients with PMD. Levels of Neuroticism remained significantly higher in both PMD and PNES than HC following correction for multiple comparisons. Patients with PNES reported greater levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, overall psychopathology, greater history of sexual abuse, greater levels of alexithymia, higher levels of dissociative symptoms, and an earlier age at which they experienced their most distressing traumatic event than patients with PMD.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that personality traits, type of abuse and age of onset of trauma varies as a function of CD subtype. Patients with PNES rated greater Neuroticism and lower Conscientiousness than patients with PMD. These differing psychological profiles may inform differing treatment approaches such as psychological therapies for PNES and physiotherapy (with/without psychotherapy) for PMD.",

The purpose of this study is to describe the prehospital path for patients with acute stroke and, in particular, what distinguishes patients who contact the Emergency Medical Communication Centre (EMCC) from those who contact their general practitioner (GP) or Out-of-hours (OOH) services.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Patients with acute cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage admitted to the Stroke Unit, Department of Neurology, Akershus University Hospital, were included. Data on the prehospital path (prehospital delay, medical contacts) were collected over the period 15 April 2009 – 1 April 2010.RESULTS: A total of 299 patients were included in the study. The median age was 75 years and 48.5 % were women. In all, 63.9 % of patients with acute stroke called the EMCC, and 93.7 % of these were taken directly to hospital by ambulance. Of those who called the GP’s office or OOH services, 60.7 % were asked to go to the GP’s office or OOH services in person. Patients who called and attended the GP’s office or OOH services had milder neurological deficits (p < 0.001) and longer patient delay (p = 0.018) than those who called the EMCC.INTERPRETATION: Six out of ten patients who contacted the primary health care services were asked to go to the GP’s office/OOH services in person, which resulted in unnecessary delay. The findings from this study may indicate a need for specific training of this group of health care professionals in the prompt handling of patients with possible stroke.",

Flexion synergy is a related motor impairment that may be inadvertently neglected. Here, flexor spasticity and flexion synergy are disentangled to determine their contributions to reaching dysfunction.METHODS: Twenty-six individuals participated. A robotic device systematically modulated shoulder abduction loading during ballistic reaching. Elbow muscle electromyography data were partitioned into windows delineated by elbow joint velocity allowing for the separation of synergy- and spasticity-related activation.RESULTS: Reaching velocity decreased with abduction loading (p<0.001) such that velocity was 30% slower when lifting the arm at 50% of abduction strength compared to when arm weight was supported. Abnormal flexion synergy increased with abduction loading (p<0.001) such that normalized activation ranged from a median (interquartile range) of 0.07 (0.03-0.12) when arm weight was supported to 0.19 (0.12-0.40) when actively lifting (large effect size, d=0.59). Flexor spasticity was detected during reaching (p=0.016) but only when arm weight was supported (intermediate effect size, d=0.33).CONCLUSION: Flexion synergy is the predominant contributor to reaching dysfunction while flexor spasticity appears only relevant during unnaturally occurring passively supported movement.SIGNIFICANCE: Interventions targeting flexion synergy should be leveraged in future stroke recovery trials.",

All patients underwent electroencephalogram (EEG) at least once in the disease peak stage, and received tumor screening, symptomatic therapy, and immunotherapy. Patients received outcome evaluation every 6months after the immunotherapy, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-2 was defined as favorable outcome.RESULTS: This study enrolled 62 cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients, including 29 males (46.8%) and 33 females (53.2%). The patient ages were between 10 and 59 (mean 26.3±11.3) years. A total of 93 instances of EEG monitoring were performed on 62 patients. At the peak stage, EEG presentations showed 61 cases (98.4%) were abnormal, cranial MRI showed 29 cases (46.8%) were abnormal among all 62 patients. The main presentations of abnormal EEG were diffuse slowing (25 cases, 40.3%), epileptiform discharges (11 cases, 17.7%), extreme delta brush (EDB) (10 cases, 16.1%), polymorphic delta rhythm (6 cases, 9.7%), focal slowing (5 cases, 8.1%), and diffuse beta activities (4 cases, 6.5%). Patients with normal background, epileptiform discharges, polymorphic delta rhythm, and diffuse beta activity in EEG all had favorable long-term outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The majority of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients had abnormal EEG. EEG could sensitively reflect the abnormal brain functions of patients and could assist with early clinical diagnosis and prognosis prediction.SIGNIFICANCE: Diffuse slowing was the most common presentation on the EEG in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The EEG pattern of normal background, epileptiform discharges, polymorphic delta rhythm, and diffuse beta activities at the peak stage might suggest favorable long-term prognosis.",

Methods Fifteen consecutive cases of tandem occlusions treated with the endovascular approach between January 2014 and May 2016 were reviewed. The study cohort included patients with an etiology of large vessel atherosclerosis. Extracranial carotid stenting was performed in another session if post-thrombectomy mRS modified Rankin Score (mRS) was 0-2. Good clinical outcome was determined by follow-up at 7-10, 30 and 90 days according to the mRS. Results Most patients (80%) were male. Eight (53.4%) patients received intravenous thrombolysis before angiography. Proximal revascularization was successful in 100% of cases with balloon angioplasty internal carotid artery (ICA) origin. Successful recanalization (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) 2b-3) (mTICI 2 b-3) occurred in 12 cases (80%) and good clinical outcomes were achieved in 10 patients (66.7%). Cervical ICA stent placement was performed in 10 patients with good clinical outcomes. No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred after delayed ICA stenting Conclusions This is the first reported case series to evaluate this approach for endovascular treatment of tandem occlusions. Carotid angioplasty-assisted mechanical thrombectomy without urgent stenting seems to be a safer approach.",

In France, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been estimated from cohorts to be about 1-3 per 1000 inhabitants, but exhaustive data are scarce for the general population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PD in the Hauts-de-France region and to assess PD-related healthcare consumption.METHOD: A descriptive study was conducted to identify the parkinsonian population in the Hauts-de-France region (including the administrative districts of Pas-de-Calais and Picardie) for the year 2014. Parkinsonian patients were identified from health insurance fund reimbursement data using the following criteria: (i) reimbursement for a PD-specific medication; (ii) attribution of long-duration disease status coded as PD; (iii) hospital stay with PD diagnosis in the standard discharge report contained in the French medico-economic database on hospital activity (PMSI).RESULTS: The raw prevalence of PD in the region was 5.03 per 1000 inhabitants aged 20 years and older. The standardized prevalence by health territory ranged from 4.0 to 9.0 per 1000 inhabitants aged 20 years and older. During the 1-year study period, 33.5% of patients had a neurology consultation, 57.1% attended a physiotherapy session, and 7.7% received speech therapy. Most of patients (79.6%) were treated with levodopa, sometimes in combination with a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor (14.4%). Dopaminergic agonists were prescribed in 33.5% of cases. A neuroleptic was prescribed for 6.9% of the population (clozapine for 25.9%).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PD is high in the Hauts-de-France region with a heterogeneous distribution by health territory. Neurology consultations were attended by a minority of patients in 2014. This work provides perspectives for necessary improvement in specialized care for this disease, both in terms of follow-up consultations and home care.",

We present the case of a 16-year-old girl with anaplastic medulloblastoma treated with gross total resection and high-dose craniospinal radiation with adjuvant vincristine chemotherapy who developed acute-onset severe quadriplegia and vocal cord paralysis. Vincristine and radiation therapy were discontinued. Although her neuropathy slowly improved over several weeks, she developed metastatic extraneural medulloblastoma and died 5 months after diagnosis. Subsequent genetic testing revealed previously asymptomatic and undiagnosed CMT1A. Our case highlights the importance of early recognition of acute vincristine neurotoxicity that should raise suspicion of an underlying hereditary neuropathy.",

Our study compared basic surveillance through active medical record review with a linked administrative data file to assess the number of cases of two rare conditions, fragile X syndrome (FXS) and muscular dystrophy (MD) in a population.METHODS: Two methods of data collection were used to collect information from five counties comprising two standard metropolitan statistical areas of South Carolina. The passive system relied mostly on health claims data using ICD-9 CM diagnostic codes. The active system relied on a nurse abstracting records from a list of all licensed physicians with specialties in neurology, orthopedics, and genetics.RESULTS: There were 141 FXS cases and 348 MD cases that met the case definitions using active surveillance. Additional cases were found for both conditions but they were determined to not be true cases. After linking the actively collected MD and FXS cases to passive datasets, we found that the estimated total numbers of cases were similar to using capture-recapture analysis; the positive predictive values for cases identified in the passive system were 56.6% for MD and 75.7% for FXS.CONCLUSIONS: Applying capture-recapture methods to passively collected surveillance data for rare health conditions produced an estimate of the number of true cases that was similar to that obtained through active data collection.",

Yet, populations in low- and middle-income countries are underrepresented in studies that aim to explore stakeholders' perspectives on the use of such technologies. Within the framework of a research project entitled \"Personalized medicine in the treatment of epilepsy\", we sought to increase inclusiveness by widening the reach of our survey, inviting neurologists from around the world to share their views and practices regarding the use of whole-genome sequencing in clinical neurology and its associated ethics. We discuss herein the compelling scientific and ethical reasons that led us to attempt to recruit neurologists worldwide, despite the lack, in many low- or middle-income countries, of access to genomic technologies. Recruitment procedures and their results are presented and discussed, as well as the barriers we faced. We conclude that inclusive recruitment remains a challenging, albeit necessary and legitimate, endeavour.",

Under such circumstances, patients may be misdiagnosed as having a hyperacute stroke, i.e. stroke mimic. The purpose of the present study was to explore the clinical features and consequences of patients with parkinsonism or other movement disorders presenting as stroke mimics with activation of a stroke code.METHODS: In this retrospective case-series study, we reviewed the charts and stroke code registry data in two stroke centers with high volume of stroke codes and thrombolytic therapy in the Southern Taiwan.RESULTS: We found seven male patients (67.0 ± 12.8 years old): one with focal myoclonus, one with focal dystonia, and the other five with parkinsonism. The chief problems for emergency department visit included acute consciousness disturbance in one patient and motor weakness in other six patients. Five of the six patients with motor weakness complained unilateral symptoms. Six patients were evaluated by neurology residents (five by second-year residents, one by a third-year resident) and one by a board-certified neurologist, while a misdiagnosis of a stroke was made in three patients. All patients experienced neurological improvement when follow-up. One patient who received intravenous thrombolytic therapy had no intracranial hemorrhagic complications.CONCLUSION: Although rare, parkinsonism or other movement disorders may present as a stroke mimic with activation of a stroke code. Consulting neurologists should clarify the etiology for those patients with acute consciousness disturbance or motor weakness and avoid unnecessary thrombolysis. Key Words: Parkinson disease, parkinsonism, movement disorders, stroke code, thrombolysis.",

This study investigated whether the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could distinguish patients with SAH from those with migraine.METHODS: This retrospective study was performed after research ethics committee approval. Data were gathered from the ED and neurology clinics of a university hospital between January 2015 and January 2016, from patients with symptoms of headache (primarily), nausea and vomiting. One hundred and twenty one with SAH, 123 patients with migraine and 987 with other primary headache syndromes were considered. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios (NLR-1) were compared between groups on admission. In SAH patients NLR taken on the 24th-30th hour of admission (NLR-2) was compared to admission NLR.RESULTS: NLR values, showed that the median NLR values of SAH patients were significantly higher than migraine and other headaches group values (p<0.001; p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the NLR values of the migraine and control groups (p>0.05). An NLR cut-off value of 4.02 produced 85.95% sensitivity, 97.46% specificity, a 33.79 positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and a 0.14 negative likelihood ratio (LR-). A statistically significant increase was observed in median NLR-2 values compared to median NLR-1 values in SAH patients (p<0.001).CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, NLR distinguished patients with SAH from those with migraine. Presence of SAH should be evaluated from discharged and readmitted patients (with headache symptoms) when an increase in NLR between initial and readmission levels is observed.",

We also explored the performance of the SLAQ in patients with short (< 1 year) versus long (? 1 year) disease duration.METHOD: Patients filled out the SLAQ before physicians' assessments. Correlations between SLAQ total, subscales (Symptom score, Flares, Patients global) and SLAM and SLEDAI-2K, as well as between the corresponding items in SLAQ and SLAM, were evaluated using Spearman's ñ. Comparisons between patients with different disease durations were performed with Mann-Whitney U or chi-squared tests.RESULTS: We included 203 patients (79% women), with a median age of 45 years [interquartile range (IQR) 33-57 years] and disease duration of 5 years (IQR 0-14 years). Correlations between physicians' SLAM without laboratory items (SLAM-nolab) and patients' assessments were: SLAQ total, ñ = 0.685, Symptom score, ñ = 0.651, Flares, ñ = 0.547, and Patients global, ñ = 0.600. Of the symptom items, fatigue (ñ = 0.640), seizures (ñ = 0.635), and headache (ñ = 0.604) correlated most closely. Neurology/stroke syndrome, skin, and lymphadenopathy correlated less well (ñ < 0.24). Patients' and physicians' assessments were notably more discordant for patients with short disease durations.CONCLUSION: We confirm that the SLAQ can be used to monitor disease activity. However, the discrepancy between patients' and physicians' assessments was greater for patients with short versus long disease duration. We encourage further use of the SLAQ, but would like to develop a shorter version which would be valuable in modern, partly web-based, clinical care.",

There were 3 maternal deaths in women with epilepsy during this time, which represents a mortality rate of 0.8%. In those women who died, there were concerns in relation to risks to the foetus by taking Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AED) and also issues with access to neurology services before pregnancy, acceptance of specialist support and lack of consistency in advice from health care professionals outside of Ireland. Implementing the nationally agreed care plan for women with epilepsy will improve the quality of care given and potentially we will see a reduction in maternal mortality in these women.",

Additionally, whether these complaints were affected by characteristics such as age at onset of Parkinson disease, sex, disease duration, and severity was investigated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study comprised a total of 79 individuals, 39 Parkinson patients and a control group of 40 individuals. Parkinson diagnosis was provided by a neurology expert according to the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria. All patients were evaluated by a urologist with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and an overactive bladder (OAB) questionnaire.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the Parkinson patient group had statistically significantly higher rates of urological complaints (P < 0.001), irritative symptoms (P < 0.001), voiding symptoms (P < 0.001), OAB score (P < 0.001), IPSS total score (P = 0.007), and treatment requirements (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Urologic complaints were observed more frequently in the Parkinson patient group compared to the control group. Another important result of this study is that in the Parkinson patient group there was no difference found between urologic complaints in terms of sex.",

The Zarit Burden Interview was used to assess caregiver burden. The brief version of World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale to assess quality of life and anxiety and depression subscales of symptom checklist-revised were administered to assess caregivers' vulnerability towards psychopathology.RESULTS: There were 6 males and 54 females caregivers with mean age of 37.60 ±14.87 years. The burden of caregiving had negative relationship (-0.57; -0.50; -0.48; and -0.50, respectively) with physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains of quality of life. Neither caregiver burden nor quality of life predicted for anxiety and depression in the caregivers.CONCLUSION: Caregiver burden may impair quality of life of caregivers but results imply the need to identify the interpersonal and intrapersonal characteristics of caregivers that buffered the adverse effects of caregiver burden and impaired the quality of life on psychological wellbeing of the patients with AD.",

To date, only a few patients have been reported worldwide. Their clinical presentation has been remarkably consistent with primary features of severe psychomotor retardation, encephalopathy, hypotonia, and infantile-onset refractory epilepsy. We report a new case of ABAT deficiency that marks an important departure from previous clinical findings. The patient presented at age 6 months with global developmental delay, hypotonia, hypersomnolence and mild choreiform movements. At age 18 months, the subject's clinical presentation was still milder than all previously reported patients and, most notably, did not include seizures. Clinical whole exome sequencing revealed two heterozygous ABAT missense variants that are rare and predicted damaging, but never before reported in a patient and were reported as variants of unknown significance. To test the potential pathogenicity of the variants identified in this patient we developed a cell-based system to test both functions of the ABAT protein via GABA transaminase enzyme activity and mtDNA copy number assays. This systematic approach was validated using vigabatrin, the irreversible inhibitor of ABAT, and leveraged to test the functionality of all ABAT variants in previously reported patients plus the variants in this new case. This work confirmed the novel variants compromised ABAT function to similar levels as variants in previously characterized cases with more severe clinical presentation, thereby confirming the molecular diagnosis of this patient. Additionally, functional studies conducted in cells from both mild and severe patient fibroblasts showed similar levels of compromise in mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory capacity, ATP production and mtDNA depletion. These results illustrate how cell-based functional studies can aid in the diagnosis of a rare, neurological disorder. Importantly, this patient marks an expansion in the clinical phenotype for ABAT deficiency to a milder presentation that is more commonly seen in pediatric genetics and neurology clinics.",

In the present study, we used small-animal PET to characterize the expression of molecular targets in the recently reported HD animal model, the zQ175 mouse model. Methods: Male heterozygous zQ175 (Htttm1Mfc/190JChdi, CHDI-81003003) and wild-type (WT, C57BL/6J) animals were imaged with the dopamine D2 receptor radioligand 11C-raclopride, the PDE10A radioligand 18F-MNI-659, the dopamine D1 receptor radioligand 11C-NNC 112, and the 5-HT2A radioligand 11C-MDL 100907 at 6 and 9 mo of age. The outcome measure was the binding potential (BPND), using the cerebellum as the reference region. Selected regions of interest were the striatum for all radioligands and additionally the striatum, rostral cortex, caudal cortex, and hippocampus for 11C-NNC 112 and 11C-MDL 100907. Results: At 6 mo of age, the BPND in the striatum was lower in zQ175 than WT animals by 40% for 11C-raclopride, by 52% for 18F-MNI-659, by 28% for 11C-NNC, and by 11% for 11C-MDL 100907. In the rostral cortex, D1 receptor binding was 22% lower in zQ175 than WT animals. We found an overall reduction in D1 and 5-HT2A binding in the hippocampus of zQ175 compared with WT animals. The BPND of 11C-MDL 100907 in the caudal cortex was also lower in zQ175 WT animals. At 9 mo, there was a slight further reduction of D1, D2, and 5-HT2ABPND in the striatum, whereas PDE10A reached a plateau. Cortical markers were also slightly further decreased at 9 mo in zQ175 animals. Conclusion: Our study indicates a marked reduction of ligand binding to D1 and D2 and 5-HT2A receptors as well as loss of PDE10A enzyme in the striatum of zQ175 mice as compared with WT animals, in agreement with data obtained in clinical PET studies of patients with HD. The zQ175 mouse model recapitulates the expression pattern seen in humans with HD and may have value in further elucidating pathophysiologic events and therapeutic strategies.",

Acinetobacter baumannii was the leading organism of infection in almost every ICU, especially in emergency, neurosurgery, and neonatal ICUs. The most common pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the cardiothoracic surgery, emergency, and neonatal ICUs; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in the neurosurgery, emergency, neonatal, and neurology ICUs; and Candida albicans in both neurology and emergency ICUs.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that A baumannii and P aeruginosa were the most common pathogens associated with invasive operations, whereas K pneumoniae and E coli were the most common pathogens in the medical ICUs.",

The Cambridge Behavioural Inventory (CBI) is a self-report measure aimed at relatives which takes account of a wide range of behavioural symptoms that may occur during the course of neurological diseases. The main objective of the study is to test the clinical usefulness of its Spanish adaptation.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The CBI was completed by 215 members of kin of patients referred from neurology and psychiatry services. The CBI profiles of four groups of patients were compared, these being grouped according to their main clinical characteristics, psychometric data, imaging tests and the clinical judgement of the professional requesting the neuropsychological study.RESULTS: Most of the scales (10 out of 13) of the CBI yielded acceptable internal consistency values, and the memory and attention/orientation scales showed high correlations with objective measures of memory and time orientation. The CBI profiles of the groups of patients with different conditions (organic memory disorder, functional memory disorder, behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease) were consistent with their main features.CONCLUSIONS: The CBI is a psychometrically reliable instrument with adequate convergent and discriminant validity that can be useful in the process of neuropsychological assessment. It can provide relevant information not only about cognitive functioning and the functional capabilities, but also about the behavioural and psychological symptoms of patients with cognitive disorders.",

No epidemiological data are available for the disease.METHODS: All neurology departments in Austria were addressed to report adult patients who were on immunosuppressive treatment for a diagnosis of Susac's syndrome between 1 August 2010 and 1 August 2015. Clinical course, treatment regimens, period and point prevalence rates, and annual incidence of Susac's syndrome in Austria in people over 19 years of age are reported.RESULTS: Ten patients with Susac's syndrome were identified, and eight of them were newly diagnosed within the five-year timeframe. Minimum five-year period prevalence of the disease is 0.148/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.071-0.272), annual incidence is 0.024/100,000 (95% CI 0.010-0.047). Minimum point prevalence rates varied from 0.030/100,000 (95% CI 0.004-0.108) to 0.088/100,000 (95% CI 0.032-0.192). Of all 10 patients, 8 showed typical callosal or internal capsule magnetic resonance imaging lesions at first presentation, 7 presented with BRAO and 5 had hearing loss or tinnitus at the beginning of the disease. Four patients developed the complete clinical triad of Susac's syndrome during the observation period.CONCLUSIONS: We provide for the first time population-based data about the clinical course, prevalence and incidence of Susac's syndrome.",

We completed 47 interviews regarding 15 patients with family members (n = 16), nurses (n = 15), and physicians (n = 16).RESULTS: Two themes were identified: (1) hope and (2) personhood. (1) Families linked prognostic uncertainty to a need for hope and expressed a desire for physicians to acknowledge this relationship. The language of hope varied depending on the participant: clinicians used hope as an object that can be given or taken away, generally in the process of conveying prognosis, while families expressed hope as an action that supported coping with their loved one's acute illness and its prognostic uncertainty. (2) Participants described the loss of personhood through brain injury, the need to recognize and treat the brain-injured patient as a person, and the importance of relatedness and connection, including personal support of families by clinicians.CONCLUSIONS: Support for hope and preservation of personhood challenge care in the neuro-ICU as identified by families and clinicians of patients with SABI. Specific practical approaches can address these challenges and improve the palliative care provided to patients and families in the neuro-ICU.",

Changes in cytokines have been hypothesized to be associated with the etiology of post-stroke depression (PSD). The altere dhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning is associated with the onset of depression. The activity of HPA could induce the fluctuations of cortisol levels. In this study, we prospectively checked interleukin 6 (IL-6) and cortisol levels in patients with early ischemic stroke. It was hypothesized that early serum IL-6 and cortisol fluctuations in stroke patients were the predictions of PSD. Totally, 100 participants were selected from stroke inpatients consecutively admitted to the Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital from July 2014 to December 2015. Fifty health people served as the controls. The serum of all the patients was collected at 8:00 am and 4:00 pm respectively one week after stroke. The serum of controls was collected only at 8:00 am. The levels of IL-6 were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, and those of cortisol were detected by chemiluminescence immunoassay. On the 3rd week after stroke, the patients were enrolled to the PSD group and non-PSD group based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21, score>7). The IL-6 level (13.24±2.89 ng/L) was elevated significantly in PSD groups as compared with that in non-PSD group and control group respectively (P<0.05 for both), but there was no significant difference in the IL-6 level between non-PSD group and control group. The patients in both PSD group and non-PSD group had significantly elevated morning cortisol levels in comparison with those in the control group (P<0.05; for PSD, non-PSD and control: 508.86±119.51, 420.83±70.04 and 340.40±76.30 nmol/L respectively). Moreover, afternoon cortisol levels in PSD group were significantly higher than those in non-PSD group, and the morning baseline cortisol levels in these two groups were similar (P>0.05). It was suggested that PSD generally runs a chronic course and is related to a variety of adverse health outcomes including increased disability, morbidity and mortality.

In addition, comparisons between governmental and private sectors, as well as between regions, are to be performed.METHODS: A cross sectional study conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to the secondary and tertiary hospitals without EMUs throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The study was conducted from September 2013 to September 2015 and regular updates from all respondents were constantly made. Items in the questionnaire included the region of the institution, the number of pediatric and adult neurologists and neurosurgeons along with their subspecialties, the number of beds in the Neurology Department, whether they provide educational services and have epilepsy clinics and if they refer patients to an EMU or intend to establish one in the future.RESULTS: Forty-three institutions throughout the Kingdom responded, representing a response rate of 54%. The majority of hospitals (58.1%) had no adult epileptologists. A complete lack of pediatric epileptologists was observed in 72.1% of hospitals. Around 39.5% were utilizing beds from internal medicine. Hospitals with an epilepsy clinic represented 34.9% across all regions and sectors. Hospitals with no intention of establishing an EMU represented 53.5%. Hospitals that did not refer their epileptic patients to an EMU represented 30.2%.CONCLUSION: Epilepsy services in KSA hospitals without EMUs are underdeveloped.",

The aim of our study is to examine real situations in which there has been a breach of confidentiality, by means of direct observation in clinical practice.METHODS: By means of direct observation, our study examines real situations in which there has been a breach of confidentiality in a tertiary hospital. To observe and collect data on these situations, we recruited students enrolled in the Medical Degree Program at the University of Cordoba. The observers recorded their entries on standardized templates during clinical internships in different departments: Internal Medicine; Gynecology and Obstetrics; Pediatrics; Emergency Medicine; General and Digestive Surgery; Maxillofacial Surgery; Plastic Surgery; Orthopedics and Traumatology; Digestive; Dermatology; Rheumatology; Mental Health; Nephrology; Pneumology; Neurology; and Ophthalmology.RESULTS: Following 7138 days and 33157 h of observation, we found an estimated Frequency Index of one breach per 62.5 h. As regards the typology of the observed breaches, the most frequent (54,6 %) were related to the consultation and/or disclosure of clinical and/or personal data to medical personnel not involved in the patient's clinical care, as well as people external to the hospital. As regards their severity, severe breaches were the most frequent, accounting for 46.7 % of all incidents. Most of the reported incidents were observed in public areas (37.9 %), such as corridors, elevators, the cafeteria, stairs, and locker rooms.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to aspects related to hospital organization or infrastructure, we have shown that all healthcare personnel are involved in confidentiality breaches, especially physicians. While most are committed unintentionally, a non-negligible number are severe, repeated breaches (9.5 %), thus suggesting a certain carelessness, perhaps through ignorance about certain behaviors that can jeopardize patient confidentiality.",

This retrospective cohort study performed whole exome sequencing on 57 patients of \"Magen\" neurogenetic clinics, with unknown diagnoses despite previous workup. The authors report on clinical features, causative genes, and treatment modifications and provide an analysis of whole exome sequencing utility per primary clinical feature. A causative gene was identified in 49.1% of patients, of which 17 had an autosomal dominant mutation, 9 autosomal recessive, and 2 X-linked. The highest rate of positive diagnosis was found for patients with developmental delay, ataxia, or suspected neuromuscular disease. Whole exome sequencing warranted a definitive change of treatment for 5 patients. Genetic databases were updated accordingly. In conclusion, whole exome sequencing is useful in obtaining a high detection rate for previously undiagnosed disorders. Use of this technique could affect diagnosis, treatment, and prognostics for both patients and relatives.",

Aiming to increase awareness of this rare disorder among neurotologists, we describe differential diagnoses, work-up, and management strategies.PATIENT: A 67-year-old man treated for vestibular schwannoma at a single tertiary referral center.INTERVENTION: Surgery for vestibular schwannoma, electromyography for confirmation of diagnosis, and physical therapy.MAIN OUTCOME AND RESULTS: After ruling out postoperative complications by intracranial imaging and physical examination, electromyography was confirmatory of the suspected diagnosis, Parsonage-Turner syndrome; steroids were not indicated. With physical therapy as treatment, our patient is experiencing gradual recovery of all neurologic deficits, including gross motor function.CONCLUSION: As a rare condition reported only sporadically in the orthopedic and neurology literature, our patient with Parsonage-Turner syndrome represents (to our knowledge) the first within neurotology literature. This rare, idiopathic disease process is usually self-limiting, and may mimic cerebral-vascular accident or injury from surgical positioning. Its presentation is one of limited motor and sensory neuropathies of the brachial plexus distribution.",

In the present study, the sample included 213 patients admitted to the department of neurology from January 2012 through October 2012. MRI and retinal photography were performed within 48hours of hospitalization, and patient demographics, comorbidities, preadmission medications and laboratory data were collected. MRI images were used to divide the patients into LA and non-LA groups. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, the effects of retinopathy on LA were investigated. Of the 213 patients enrolled, 168 were included in this study (LA, n=108; non-LA, n=60). Hypertension, coronary heart disease and carotid artery plaque were more common in the LA group, and these patients showed higher blood levels of C-reactive protein, homocysteine and triglycerides. The incidence of retinopathy was significantly increased in the LA group compared with the non-LA group, and there was a significant correlation between the severity of LA and incidence of retinopathy. Retinopathy is an independent risk factor for LA and can significantly increase the risk of LA when combined with age, coronary heart disease, C-reactive protein, carotid artery plaque or systolic pressure. Taken together, retinopathy is associated with LA in patients with anterior circulation infarcts. Retinopathy is an independent risk factor for LA and an increase the risk of LA, and thus facilitating the evaluation of LA.",

Furthermore, the number of participants in these studies has not exceeded a few hundred. To overcome these limitations, we have determined, in a multicenter study, the prevalence of delirium over a single day among a large population of patients admitted to acute and rehabilitation hospital wards in Italy.METHODS: This is a point prevalence study (called \"Delirium Day\") including 1867 older patients (aged 65 years or more) across 108 acute and 12 rehabilitation wards in Italian hospitals. Delirium was assessed on the same day in all patients using the 4AT, a validated and briefly administered tool which does not require training. We also collected data regarding motoric subtypes of delirium, functional and nutritional status, dementia, comorbidity, medications, feeding tubes, peripheral venous and urinary catheters, and physical restraints.RESULTS: The mean sample age was 82.0 ± 7.5 years (58 % female). Overall, 429 patients (22.9 %) had delirium. Hypoactive was the commonest subtype (132/344 patients, 38.5 %), followed by mixed, hyperactive, and nonmotoric delirium. The prevalence was highest in Neurology (28.5 %) and Geriatrics (24.7 %), lowest in Rehabilitation (14.0 %), and intermediate in Orthopedic (20.6 %) and Internal Medicine wards (21.4 %). In a multivariable logistic regression, age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.05), Activities of Daily Living dependence (OR 1.19, 95 % CI 1.12-1.27), dementia (OR 3.25, 95 % CI 2.41-4.38), malnutrition (OR 2.01, 95 % CI 1.29-3.14), and use of antipsychotics (OR 2.03, 95 % CI 1.45-2.82), feeding tubes (OR 2.51, 95 % CI 1.11-5.66), peripheral venous catheters (OR 1.41, 95 % CI 1.06-1.87), urinary catheters (OR 1.73, 95 % CI 1.30-2.29), and physical restraints (OR 1.84, 95 % CI 1.40-2.40) were associated with delirium. Admission to Neurology wards was also associated with delirium (OR 2.00, 95 % CI 1.29-3.14), while admission to other settings was not.CONCLUSIONS: Delirium occurred in more than one out of five patients in acute and rehabilitation hospital wards. Prevalence was highest in Neurology and lowest in Rehabilitation divisions. The \"Delirium Day\" project might become a useful method to assess delirium across hospital settings and a benchmarking platform for future surveys.",

High dose immunoablation followed by autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been considered in the last 15 years as potentialy effective therapeutic approach for aggressive MS. The most recent long-time follow-up results suggest that AHSCT is not only effective for highly-aggressive MS, but for relapsing-remitting MS as well, providing long-term remission, or maybe even cure. We presented a 10-year follow-up of the first MS patient being treated by immunoablation therapy and AHSCT.CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old male experienced the first symptoms--intermitent numbness and paresthesia of arms and legs of what was treated for two years by psychiatrist as anxiety disorder. After he developed severe paraparesis he was admitted to the Neurology Clinic and diagnosed with MS. Our patient developed aggressive MS with frequent relapses, rapid disability progression and transition to secondary progressive form 6 years after MS onset[the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 7.0 Ambulation Index (AI) 7]. AHSCT was performed, cyclophosphamide was used for hemopoietic stem cell mobilization and the BEAM protocol was used as conditionig regimen. No major adverse events followed the AHSCT. Neurological impairment improved, EDSS 6.5, AI 6 and during a 10-year follow-up remained unchanged. Brain MRI follow-up showed the absence of gadolinium enhancing lesions and a mild progression of brain atrophy.CONCLUSION: The patient with rapidly evolving, aggressive, noninflammatory MS initialy improved and remained stable, without disability progression for 10 years, after AHSCT. This kind of treatment should be considered in aggressive MS, or in disease modifying treatment nonresponsive MS patients, since appropriately timed AHSCT treatment may not only prevent disability progression but reduce the achieved level of disability, as well.",

Patients underwent a multidisciplinary clinical evaluation, including clinical demographics, genetic testing, symptom evaluation, neurologic examination, neuropsychological bedside testing, and socioemotional assessments. All patients underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging at their earliest evaluation at the memory clinic. From each patient's structural imaging scans, the mean volumes of 18 regions of interest (ROI) constituting the functional networks specifically vulnerable in bvFTD, including the salience network (SN), with key nodes in the frontoinsula and pregenual anterior cingulate, and the semantic appraisal network (SAN), anchored in the anterior temporal lobe and subgenual cingulate, were estimated. Principal component and cluster analyses of ROI volumes were used to identify patient clusters with anatomically distinct atrophy patterns. Data were collected from from June 19, 2002, to January 13, 2015.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Evaluation of brain morphology and other clinical features, including presenting symptoms, neurologic examination signs, neuropsychological performance, rate of dementia progression, and socioemotional function, in each patient cluster.RESULTS: Ninety patients (54 men [60%]; 36 women [40%]; mean [SD] age at evaluation, 55.1 [9.7] years) were included in the analysis. Four subgroups of patients with bvFTD with distinct anatomic patterns of network degeneration were identified, including 2 salience network-predominant subgroups (frontal/temporal [SN-FT] and frontal [SN-F]), a semantic appraisal network-predominant group (SAN), and a subcortical-predominant group. Subgroups demonstrated distinct patterns of cognitive, socioemotional, and motor symptoms, as well as genetic compositions and estimated rates of disease progression.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Divergent patterns of vulnerability in specific functional network components make an important contribution to the clinical heterogeneity of bvFTD. The data-driven anatomic classification identifies biologically meaningful anatomic phenotypes and provides a replicable approach to disambiguate the bvFTD syndrome.",

Among those viruses is bovine astrovirus CH13 (BoAstV CH13) that has been identified in Switzerland in a cow with encephalitis. Molecular testing by a combination of reverse transcription (RT-) PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) indicated that astrovirus infection accounts for around one quarter of viral encephalitis cases of unknown etiology in cattle. Yet, it remained to be explored whether these animals were infected by BoAstV CH13 or other astrovirus species. In the present study we sequenced the entire astrovirus genome in brain tissues of eight RT-PCR and/or ISH positive cattle. Phylogenetic comparison of the genomic RNA and the encoded non-structural and structural proteins revealed that all these astrovirus strains were very similar to BoAstV CH13 as well as to a bovine encephalitis strain reported from the USA (BoAstV NeuroS1), and clearly distinct from other previously reported astroviruses. Conserved 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) were predicted to display distinct secondary RNA structures, which likely play a role in viral RNA replication and/or protein translation. Based on these data we propose that BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 represents a new genotype species within the genus Mammastrovirus. The high degree of similarity between the strains and their relative distance to other genotype species suggest that during evolution some astroviruses acquired factors that specifically contribute to neuroinvasion.",

The data of 164 patients with acute cerebral infarction who accepted intra-arterial thrombolysis treatment by using rt-PA or reteplase between 2009 and 2014 at the Department of Neurology of our hospital, were collected, including patients' medical history, characteristics of the onset procedure, intervals between onset and intra-arterial thrombolysis, bleeding or death, and the changing process of patient's main neurologic function after the treatment. The neurological functions including muscle strength, speech, and level of consciousness were chosen for evaluation. Through a review of cerebral angiography, we collected the digital subtraction angiography (DSA) morphological changes of blood vessels before and after arterial thrombolysis to evaluate whether those blood vessels had been reperfused. Thereafter, we analyzed and statistically processed above-mentioned data. The mean time of arterial thrombolysis was 5.7 h. DSA results were as follows: 22 patients had complete internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion; 49 patients middle cerebral artery's (MCA's) Ml or M2 segment occlusion; 6 patients anterior cerebral artery (ACA) occlusion; 58 patients reperfusion after thrombolysis, and the recanalization rate was 76 %. Based on vertebral-basilar artery (VBA) system, 18 patients had complete occlusion, 11 patients had reperfusion after thrombolysis, and the recanalization rate was 61 %. A total of 63 patients had severe stenosis, and they had significantly improved after thrombolysis. The clinical symptoms of patients were improved: 79 out of 164 patients with paralysis had partially recovered their limb muscle strength after operation, while 33 patients had completely recovered, and there was no recovery at all of the muscle strength in 4 patients after operation. In total, 59 out of 63 patients with aphasia had improved their language function, while 19 patients with disturbance of consciousness turned for the better after arterial thrombolysis. Only one patient experienced the cerebral hemorrhage, and 14 cases had gingival bleeding, oral mucosa bleeding, and urethrorrhagia. The overall effective rates of intra-arterial thrombolysis in treating the acute cerebral infarction by reteplase had no significant differences compared to those by rt-PA, and there were no hemorrhagic complications. It is safe and effective if the arterial thrombolysis using reteplase is performed within a few hours after acute cerebral infarction onset because reteplase has a higher clinical efficacy and lower hemorrhagic transformation, which suggests that it may become a new feasible option for clinical arterial thrombolysis.

Acthar(®) Gel (repository corticotropin injection; Acthar; Mallinckrodt) to manage infantile spasms (IS).METHODS: We included all patients in the Truven Health MarketScan(®) Commercial Claims and Encounters Database and the Truven Health MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database who were diagnosed with IS from 2007 to 2012. We performed unadjusted and adjusted regressions examining the relationship between healthcare resource utilization variables and their associated costs to compare outcomes in the early and late Acthar users.RESULTS: A total of 252 patients with IS who received Acthar fit our study criteria; 191 (76%) were early Acthar users. In adjusted analyses, we found that early Acthar use was associated with, on average, 3.8 fewer outpatient services (99% CI 0.7-6.7 fewer services). We did not find significant associations between early prescriptions for Acthar and number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, prescription medications filled, or total costs of health services.CONCLUSION: Patients prescribed Acthar within 30 days of their IS diagnoses tended to have fewer outpatient services performed compared to patients prescribed Acthar later in the disease process. Although additional research is needed to confirm these exploratory findings, physicians may consider early treatment with Acthar to manage IS.FUNDING: This study was funded by a grant to the University of Washington from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.",

This essay presents three episodes that trace the emergence of drawing as an instrumental practice in the study of the mind. Between 1880 and 1930, drawings gained currency as a form of scientific evidence - as stable, reproducible signals from a hidden interior. I begin with the use of drawings as data in the child study movement, move to the telepathic transmission of drawings in psychical research and conclude with the development of drawing as an experimental and diagnostic tool for studying neurological impairment. Despite significant shifts in the theoretical and disciplinary organisation of the mind sciences in the early twentieth century, researchers attempted to stabilise the use of subject-generated drawings as evidence by controlling the contexts in which drawings were produced and reproduced, and crafting subjects whose interiority could be effectively circumscribed. While movements such as psychoanalysis and art therapy would embrace the narrative interpretation of patient art, neuropsychology continued to utilise drawings as material traces of cognitive functions.

The diagnosis of epilepsy was established in 605 (13.17%): 277 (45.79%) symptomatic, 156 (25.79%) idiopathic, and 172 (28.43%) with cryptogenic epilepsy. Absence epilepsy and benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes are the idiopathic epileptic syndromes most prevalent, and the most prevalent symptomatic epilepsies are prenatal encephalopathies. More than one-quarter (26.12%) of epilepsies began in the first year of life, and 67.72% were symptomatic. Refractory epilepsy was observed in 25.29%, 42.46% with cognitive impairment, 26.45% with motor involvement, and 9.92% with an autism spectrum disorder, being more frequent at an earlier age of onset.CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a universally accepted classification of epileptic syndromes makes tasks like this difficult, starting with the terminology. A useful classification would be aetiological, with two groups: a large group with established aetiology, or very likely genetic syndromes, and another with no established cause. The age of onset of epilepsy in each aetiological group helps in the prognosis, which is worsened by refractoriness and associated neurodevelopmental disorders, and are generally worse at an earlier onset and in certain aetiologies.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: With the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia (TH), the prediction of neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors is challenging. Early, accurate determination of prognosis by emergency physicians is important to avoid unnecessarily prolonged critical care with a likely poor neurological outcome.METHODS: This prospective observational study included patients with non-traumatic CA and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) between March 2009 and May 2012 at a tertiary academic hospital. Unconscious patients with ROSC were treated with mild TH (32°C-34°C) for 24 hours. Blood samples were collected for S-100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 0, 24 and 48 hours post-ROSC. Neurological outcomes were evaluated at hospital discharge and dichotomised as good (cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2) or poor (CPC 3, 4 or 5).RESULTS: Of the 119 patients (68.1% male, 53±15.6 years old) who underwent TH, 46 patients had a good outcome (38.9%). Poor neurological outcomes were predicted using receiver operating characteristic analyses at cut-off values of 0.12 g/L for S-100B at 24 hours post-ROSC (sensitivity, 95.0%; specificity, 75.6%; area under the curve (AUC) 0.916; 95% CI of AUC: 0.846 to 0.961), 31.03 ng/mL for NSE at 48 hours post-ROSC (sensitivity, 83.9%; specificity, 96.9%; AUC 0.929; 95% CI of AUC: 0.836 to 0.979) and 11.2 mg/dL for CRP at 48 hours post-ROSC (sensitivity, 69.4%; specificity, 75.0%; AUC 0.731; 95% CI of AUC: 0.617 to 0.827). ESR was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: Among the biomarkers, S-100B at 24 hours and NSE at 48 hours post-ROSC were highly predictive of neurological outcomes in patients treated with TH after CA.",

Smoking promotes atherosclerosis and increases dementia risk, but nicotine exerts neuroprotective effect via á7nAChR in preclinical studies. No studies explored the gene-gene, gene-environment interactions between CHRNA7 polymorphism, apolipoprotein E (APOE) å4 status and smoking on dementia risk. This case-control study recruited 254 late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and 115 vascular dementia (VaD) cases (age ?65) from the neurology clinics of three teaching hospitals in Taiwan during 2007-2010. Controls (N = 435) were recruited from health checkup programs and volunteers during the same period. Nine CHRNA7 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms representative for Taiwanese were genotyped. Among APOE å4 non-carriers, CHRNA7 rs7179008 variant carriers had significantly decreased LOAD risk after correction for multiple tests (GG + AG vs. AA: adjusted odds ratio = 0.29, 95% confidence interval = 0.13-0.64, P = 0.002). Similar findings were observed for carriers of GT haplotype in CHRNA7 block4. A significant interaction was found between rs7179008, GT haplotype in block4 and APOE å4 on LOAD risk. rs7179008 variant also reduced the detrimental effect of smoking on LOAD risk. No significant association was found between CHRNA7 and VaD. These findings help to understand dementia pathogenesis.",

However, little is known on how neurology and specialist palliative care services interact. This study aimed to map the current level of connections and integration between these services.METHODS: The mapping exercise was conducted in eight centres with neurology and palliative care services in the United Kingdom. The data were provided by the respective neurology and specialist palliative care teams. Questions focused on: i) catchment and population served; ii) service provision and staffing; iii) integration and relationships.RESULTS: Centres varied in size of catchment areas (39-5,840 square miles) and population served (142,000-3,500,000). Neurology and specialist palliative care were often not co-terminus. Service provisions for neurology and specialist palliative care were also varied. For example, neurology services varied in the number and type of provided clinics and palliative care services in the settings they work in. Integration was most developed in Motor Neuron Disease (MND), e.g., joint meetings were often held, followed by Parkinsonism (made up of Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple-System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), with integration being more developed for MSA and PSP) and least in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), e.g., most sites had no formal links. The number of neurology patients per annum receiving specialist palliative care reflected these differences in integration (range: 9-88 MND, 3-25 Parkinsonism, and 0-5 MS).CONCLUSIONS: This mapping exercise showed heterogeneity in service provision and integration between neurology and specialist palliative care services, which varied not only between sites but also between diseases. This highlights the need and opportunities for improved models of integration, which should be rigorously tested for effectiveness.",

Nowadays, array comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) is one of the most widely used techniques for diagnosing these disorders. Our purpose was to determine the phenotypic features associated with pathological results in this genetic test.METHODS: We conducted a blind study of the epidemiological, clinical, anthropometric, and morphological features of 80 patients with unexplained ID to determine which features were associated with pathological results in array-CGH.RESULTS: Pathological results were found in 27.5% of the patients. Factors associated with pathological results in array-CGH were a family history of GDD/ID (OR = 12.1), congenital malformations (OR = 5.33), having more than 3 facial dysmorphic features (OR = 20.9), and hypotonia (OR = 3.25).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with those reported by other published series. We therefore conclude that the probability of having pathological results in array-CGH increases with the presence of any of the features mentioned above in patients with ID/GDD.",

We reviewed the data of patients diagnosed with fall-related SH discharged from the Departments of Neurology/Stroke unit, Neurosurgery, Intensive Care Unit at Brotzu General Hospital (Cagliari, Italy) between January 2010 and December 2013. Patients with severe traumatisms, evidence of spontaneous intracerebral bleeding or aged less than 50 were excluded. 332 patients were selected: 69 with a neurodegenerative parkinsonism or dementia (N-group), 217 with history of chronic non-neurological medical conditions with significant disability, previous falls and/or balance problems (NND-group) and 46 with a history of \"minor\" chronic non-neurological disorder. (NN-group). The clinical status at admission and discharge was assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The time-span between trauma and hospital admission was also calculated. At hospital admission we found a significantly longer delay in SH's diagnosis (÷ (2) test p < 0.001) and a worse mRS score (Kruskal Wallis p < 0.001) in the N-group compared to both NN and NND-groups. During hospital stay we observed the lack of significant variation in mRS score in N-group (Wilcoxon test p = 0.86), in contrast with NN and NND-groups who significantly improved (Wilcoxon test p < 0.001). Our results demonstrate that the consequences of SH are more severe in the N-group compared to NN and NND-groups. The longer interval between trauma and hospital admittance plays a critical role in worsening the outcome of patients with parkinsonism and dementia compared to subjects without neurodegenerative disorders.

The aim of this study is to determine the percentage of patients with ADHD out of all patients referred to our clinic for assessment, and to explore the epidemiological and clinical factors linked to this diagnosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: retrospective analytical study of a sample of patients under 15 years old sent to the paediatric neurology clinic for suspected ADHD. DSM-IV criteria were used for diagnosis. We completed a binary logistic regression analysis to determine which risk factors were associated with the diagnosis.RESULTS: Of the 280 selected patients, 224 were male (male/female ratio 4:1); mean age (SD) was 8.4 (3.08) years. Almost half (49%) of the patients were referred by their schools and 64.9% were born in the second half of the year, but this tendency was more marked in girls than in boys. Assessment according to DSM-IV criteria resulted in diagnosis of 139 subjects (49.7%). The risk factors linked to diagnosis were male sex, parents with ADHD, associated sleep disorders, tics, and absence of neurodevelopmental delay.CONCLUSION: Only half of the children referred for suspected ADHD were diagnosed with that condition, and most were among the youngest in their classes, which suggests that suspected ADHD is overestimated. An exhaustive clinical interview investigating the family's psychological disorders and the patient's sleep disorders and tics is needed to improve the diagnostic process.",

Sequelae of these hematomas can include lower extremity paralysis from compression of the sciatic nerve. A 66-year-old woman taking aspirin and clopidogrel for coronary stents presented with a complete foot drop, paresthesias, and lower extremity pain 10 days after a total hip arthroplasty. The patient was initially seen by a neurology service at another hospital and thought to have lateral recess stenosis. At the authors' center, magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine failed to show lateral recess stenosis. Urgent pelvic computed tomography showed a large hematoma and raised suspicion of sciatic nerve compression. Hip magnetic resonance imaging showed a right gluteal hematoma compressing the sciatic nerve. The patient was then taken to the operating room for the clot to be evacuated and was later referred for rehabilitation. Massive hematomas after total hip arthroplasty are an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of nontraumatic acute foot drop. Prompt diagnosis may correlate with improved neurological outcome and help reduce overall morbidity.",

Follow-up CT scan of thorax at 12 months showed new parenchymal lung lesions that suggested schistosomiasis. Further questioning by a respiratory physician identified, in retrospect, a previous exposure history; serological testing confirmed schistosoma infection. She was treated with praziquantel and slowly improved clinically, with radiological improvement in the optic chiasm, regression of the parenchymal lung lesions but with the ground glass nodule unchanged. We diagnosed parainfectious optic neuritis associated with schistosomiasis, based upon exposure history, serological confirmation and radiological features, together with the response to treatment, and having excluded other causes of an atypical optic neuritis.

The clinical data of 5 patients with neurobrucellosis, who were treated in Department of Neurology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Captical Medical Uinversity, from May 2009 to January 2015, were collected. Their epidemiological information, clinical manifestation, laboratory and radiologic examination, therapy and prognosis were analyzed.RESULTS: Among the five patients, there were 3 males and 2 females, and their ages ranged from 20 to 67 years. The median age was 25 years. All patients had ever exposed to sheep. 1 patient lived close to a slaughterhouse and 2 patients lived in epidemic areas of brucellosis. 5 patients presented with binocular vision loss, 8 eyes with fundus edema, 3 patients with ophthalmoplegia;4 patients with fever,4 patients with headache,3 patients with neck stiffness,1 patient with movement and sensation disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure elevated, white cell number and protein increased with glucose reduction were detected respectively in 3 cases. While, CSF chloride decreased in 2 cases. Serum agglutination test for brucella was positive in 5 patients. Serum brucella culture was positive in 1 patient and CSF brucella culture was positive in 1 patient. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the optic nerve was involved in 3 patients,the meninges were involved in 1 patient and the brain white matter was involved in 1 patient. The combination of rifamycin, tetracycline, ceftriaxone sodium or quinolone were given to all patients and showed appreciated effects.CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features of ocular syndromes are atypical in patients with neurobrucellosis. Vision loss and ophthalmoplegia are more common to be seen. Neurobrucellosis should be considered when patients with ocular signs and other system symptoms without a definite diagnosis.",

The two groups were matched for age, sex, education, and vascular risk factors. All the subjects underwent the scans of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), DTI and neuropsychological assessment. The values of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured within white matter lesions (WML) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Three regions of interest (ROIs) were located in the white matter of centrum semiovale, anterior periventricular white matter and posterior periventricular white matter. The relationships between the cognitive function and the abnormalities of DTI parameters were analyzed.RESULTS: (1) Patients with LA performed significantly worse cognitive function, especially in the fields of executive function. The results of our study showed that patients with LA were associated with comprehensive cognitive function deficits, including mini mental state examination (MMSE) (24.4 ± 3.2 vs 28.3 ± 1.2), montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) (21.2 ± 3.4 vs 25.7 ± 1.7), Stroop B (69.2 ± 13.5 vs 43.3 ± 5.0), Stroop C (141.2 ± 42.6 vs 64. 8 ± 10.0), Stroop (C-B) (72.0 ± 41.9 vs 21.5 ± 9.4), trail making test (TMT)-A (73.4 ± 15.4 vs 31.1 ± 7.1), TMT-B (126.2 ± 17.5 vs 81.4 ± 5.7), digit symbol test (25.2 ± 5 .4 vs 36.7 ± 5.1) (all P<0.05). (2) The values of FA were lower, and MD were higher in WML than NAWM and controls in all the three ROIs (P<0.05). The values of FA in NAWM located in centrum semiovale and posterior periventricular white matter were lower than controls (P<0.05). The values of MD in NAWM located in anterior periventricular white matter were higher than controls (P<0.05). (3) The values of FA of NAWM located in anterior periventricular correlated inversely with the Z scores of executive function (r=-0.311, P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LA are related with significant cognitive impairment, especially in the domains of executive dysfunction. Microstructural integrity of both white matter lesions and NAWM is associated with executive function. The underlying executive dysfunction in LA may attribute to the damage of the prefrontal-subcortical circle.",

The analyses covered patients with diagnosis \"G00-G99 Diseases of the nervous system\" according to the International Classification of Diseases and underwent physiotherapy treatment.RESULTS: In 2009 altogether 190986 patients with neurological disorders received physiotherapy treatment in outpatient care, representing 1331675 cases and got 388.215 million Hungarian Forint health insurance reimbursement. The number of patients with nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders was 39 patients/10 000 population for males and 66 patients/10000 population for females. The number of patients with cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes was 49 patients/10000 population for males and 35 patients/10000 population for females. The number of patients with episodic and paroxysmal disorders was 33 patients/10000 population for males and 52 patients/10000 population for females.CONCLUSION: In the outpatient physiotherapy care the utilization indicators for female patients were higher in nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders and episodic and paroxysmal disorders, while in cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes the utilization by male patients was higher. There are important age and gender inequalities in the utilization of physiotherapy care of patients with neurological disorders.",

Furthermore, compared with MA patients, increased ReHo values in the right cerebellum and brainstem were shown in the MwoA group (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the resting-state abnormalities of these regions may be associated with functional impairments in pain processing in migraine.Specifically, the results of brain regions may reflect both the similarities and differences of pathophysiological mechanisms relative to the major subtypes of migraine.",

Lobar atrophy, leukoaraiosis (LA), lacunar infarcts (LI) and vascular risk factors were analyzed in the 116 SIVD patients who were divided into three groups according to the diagnostic criteria: non-cognitive impairment group (SIVD-NCI) , mild cognitive impairment group (SIVD-MCI) and dement group (SIVD-VaD). All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 3.0-T system. The cognitive functions were evaluated by mini-metal state examination (MMSE), the Cambridge cognitive examination-Chinese version (CAMCOG-C), etc. A widely used visual atrophy rating method (0 to 3) was adopted to rate the severity of frontal, parietal and temporal lobe atrophy. The degree of LA and the numbers of LI in 4 brain regions (frontal, parieto-occipital, temporal, and basal ganglia) were evaluated meanwhile.RESULTS: Firstly, both the SIVD-MCI and SIVD-VaD groups showed significantly higher total scores of atrophy, higher frontal lobe atrophy scores, higher LA scores and larger LI numbers than SIVD-NCI (H=6.138, P=0.013; H=45.845, P=0.000; H=36.818, P=0.000; H=37.46, P=0.000). There were no significant differences in temporal lobe atrophy scores between SIVD-NCI group and SIVD-MCI group. Parietal lobe atrophy scores also showed no differences among the three groups. Secondly, as well as total numbers of LI, total scores of atrophy and LA were negatively correlated with SIVD cognition, especially frontal lobe atrophy scores, parieto-occipital LA scores and basal ganglia LI numbers had a remarkable negative correlation with MMSE scores, CAMCOG-C scores and partial subitems in CAMCOG-C scores (P<0.005). However temporal LI numbers was absence of correlation with MMSE scores, CAMCOG-C scores and subitems in CAMCOG-C scores (P>0.005). Thirdly, education (OR= 0.787, P=0.009), total scores of LA (OR= 1.201, P=0.036) and total numbers of LI (OR= 1.221, P=0.011) remained to be associated with cognition after controlling for sex, age, education, hypertension, diabetes, smoking. While, after adjusting atrophy scores, total scores of LA had no significant association with cognition. Atrophy scores, total numbers of LI and education still showed significant association with cognition, particularly frontal lobe atrophy scores (OR= 16.082, P=0.000), but not temporal and parietal lobe atrophy scores.CONCLUSIONS: Brain atrophy may be a new and independent predictive index of cognitive impairment in SIVD. Further, the effect of brain atrophy, the numbers of LI and degree of LA on cognitive decline is independent and decreases in turn.",

Children meeting predefined clinical or laboratory thresholds have more intensive evaluations to determine whether they meet criteria for adverse events.METHODS: Adverse event \"cases\" were defined for the following domains: growth, hearing, language, neurology, neurodevelopment, metabolic, hematologic/clinical chemistry and blood lactate. We used adjusted log-binomial models to calculate relative risks (RR) of case status overall and within individual domains for various antiretroviral exposures during pregnancy.RESULTS: Among 2680 youth enrolled between 2007 and 2012 (48% female, 66% black, 33% Hispanic), 48% met a trigger and 25% were defined as a case in at least one domain. Language (13.2%) and metabolic (11.4%) cases were most common. After adjustment for birth cohort and other factors, there was no association of any antiretroviral regimen, drug class, or individual drug with meeting overall case criteria (case in any domain). Within individual domains, zidovudine (74% exposed) was associated with increased risk of metabolic case [RR = 1.69, 95%confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.64] and didanosine plus stavudine (<1% exposed) with increased risk of both neurodevelopmental (RR = 12.40, 95%CI 5.29-29.08) and language (RR = 4.84, 95%CI 1.14-20.51) cases.CONCLUSION: Our findings support current recommendations for combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, although higher risk of metabolic disorder with zidovudine exposure warrants further study.",

Patients with first-time anterior circulation TIA (diagnosed within 24 h of onset) and normal cognition, treated between August 2009 and August 2014 at the Department of Neurology of Chengdu Military General Hospital, China, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent whole-brain CTPI within 1 week of TIA to detect cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP) in the ischemic region. Based on cognitive function assessment 4 weeks after TIA, using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and mini mental state examination, the patients were divided into control and VCI groups. CTPI parameters and other clinical data were compared between groups, and Spearman's correlation analysis used to identify associations between cognitive scores and CTPI parameters in the VCI group. 50 patients (25 per group; aged 55-72 years) were included. Patient age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, time from TIA onset to admission, time from TIA onset to CTPI, and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and hyperhomocysteinemia did not differ between groups. Both groups showed TTP and MTT prolongation, CBF reduction, but no change in CBV in the ischemic region; these changes were significantly larger in the VCI group (P < 0.05). MTT correlated negatively with MoCA score (r = -0.51, P = 0.009). CTPI could facilitate early diagnosis of VCI in patients with anterior circulation TIA. ",

Studies have shown cognitive deficits, depressive symptoms and a high incidence of anxiety personality traits that compromise both the functionality and the quality of life of these patients.AIM: To describe the cognitive and psychopathological profile of a sample of patients with the adult variant of MD-1.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sample of 27 patients diagnosed with MD-1 was selected from those being followed up in the neurology service of the Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra. Eligibility criteria were age under 50 years and the absence of any other pathology or physical condition that prevented them from performing the psychological evaluation. A neuropsychological evaluation battery specifically designed for this kind of pathology was used, together with psychopathological and functionality measures.RESULTS: The neuropsychological evaluation revealed mainly deficits in visual-constructional and visuospatial skills, alternating attention and in other-reported dysexecutive signs and symptoms. The group of patients did not present any clinically significant symptoms of depression or anxiety, but did score high on obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, paranoid ideation and psychoticism. The results point towards a deterioration in functionality.CONCLUSIONS: In the integral approach to MD-1, the characterisation and developmental monitoring of the cognitive, psychopathological and personality profile, as well as the level of functionality, all contribute to an improvement in the quality of life of these patients.",

We hypothesized that a video-assisted training and certification program can improve inter-rater reliability in assessing neurologic function after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Three expert raters scored neurologic deficits in post-middle cerebral artery occlusion rats using three published systems having different complexity levels (3, 18, or 48 points). The system having the highest point estimate for the correlation between neurologic score and infarct size was selected to create a video-assisted training and certification program. Eight trainee raters completed the video-assisted training and certification program. Inter-rater agreement ( Ê: score) and agreement with expert consensus scores were measured before and after video-assisted training and certification program completion. The 48-point system correlated best with infarct size. Video-assisted training and certification improved agreement with expert consensus scores (pretraining = 65 ± 10, posttraining = 87 ± 14, 112 possible scores, P < 0.0001), median number of trainee raters with scores within ±2 points of the expert consensus score (pretraining = 4, posttraining = 6.5, P < 0.01), categories with Ê:  > 0.4 (pretraining = 4, posttraining = 9), and number of categories with an improvement in the Ê: score from pretraining to posttraining (n = 6). Video-assisted training and certification improved trainee inter-rater reliability and agreement with expert consensus behavioral scores in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Video-assisted training and certification may be useful in multilaboratory preclinical studies.",

Although several studies have assessed the awareness of different risk factors in the general public, there are limited data available on how well acute stroke patients know their own risk factors. The aim of this study was to assess stroke patients' informedness of their own stroke risk factors.METHODS: All consecutive eligible acute stroke and transient ischemic attack patients hospitalized at the Tartu University Hospital, Department of Neurology, during 9 months in 2010 were interviewed about different stroke risk factors within 72 hours from hospitalization. The respective information was also retrieved from medical records.RESULTS: Of the 341 patients admitted during the study period, 195 were eligible for the interview. Diabetes was the best known risk factor (89%) followed by hypertension (80%), atrial fibrillation (78%), previous stroke (77%), and heart failure and/or ischemic heart disease (66%).CONCLUSIONS: We found that acute stroke patients are best informed of their diabetes and worst informed of their ischemic heart disease and/or heart failure. There is, however, room for amelioration in the awareness of all of the studied risk factors. More attention should be addressed to explaining the risks and treatment options to patients at risk of stroke and the general population.",

Both periventricular WMLs (P-WMLs) and deep WMLs (D-WMLs) were identified on magnetic resonance imanging (MRI) scans and the severity was graded using the Fazekas method. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between SUA and WMLs.RESULTS: A total of 480 eligible participants were enrolled in this study. SUA level in severe group was much higher than that in mild group (for P-WMLs: 320.21 ± 79.97 vs. 286.29 ± 70.18, p = 0.000; for D-WMLs: 314.71 ± 74.74 vs. 290.07 ± 74.04, p = 0.031). Subgroup analyses showed that higher SUA level was associated with higher severity of P-WMLs in women, but not in male patients. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that SUA was still associated with increased risk of higher severity of P-WMLs (OR = 1.003, 95% = 1.000-1.006), but not D-WMLs.CONCLUSION: Elevated SUA level was independently associated with greater odds of higher severity of P-WMLs, particularly in women.",

Our aim was to investigate the effect on quality of life and post-stroke disability.METHODS: Patients admitted to the Stroke Unit, Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital, between February 2006 and July 2008 with acute cerebral infarction were prospectively registered in the NORSTROKE Registry. Patients received a postal questionnaire at least 6 months after stroke. The questionnaire included 15D©, EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D() ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Barthel Index (BI).RESULTS: Of 328 responders, 83 (25.4%) reported a vision problem. Vision problems were associated with older age (71.8 years vs. 66.5 years, P = 0.001), higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission (5.9 vs. 3.8, P < 0.001), higher modified Rankin Scale day 7 (2.0 vs. 1.4, P < 0.001) and lower BI day 7 (85.7 vs. 93.9, P = 0.002). Patients with vision problems had lower median EQ-5D utility score (0.62 vs. 0.80, P < 0.001), lower median 15D utility score (0.73 vs. 0.89, P < 0.001), higher median HADS score (12 vs. 5, P < 0.001), higher median FSS score (5.6 vs. 4.3, P < 0.001) and lower median BI (95 vs. 100, P < 0.001) on long-term follow-up. Patients with self-reported vision problems scored lower on all sub-scores of BI on follow-up (all P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: One in four patients reported a vision problem on follow-up after cerebral infarction. Vision problems after cerebral infarction reduce quality of life and are associated with increased disability. Thorough diagnostic evaluation and targeted rehabilitation is important.",

Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive oral DMF 240 mg BID or TID, placebo, or glatiramer acetate (CONFIRM only). Eligible subjects (aged 18-55 years) had an EDSS score of 0-5.0 and experienced either ?1 relapse in the 12 months or had ?1 gadolinium-enhanced lesion on brain MRI in the 6 weeks, before randomization. Data DEFINE and CONFIRM were pooled and analyzed using a negative binomial regression model (adjusted for study and region). Data obtained after subjects switched to an alternative MS therapy were not included in the analysis. Only relapses confirmed by the Independent Neurology Evaluation Committee were included in the analysis of relapses requiring IV steroids.FINDINGS: The study population (intention-to-treat) comprised 2301 patients who received either placebo (n = 771), DMF BID (n = 769), or DMF TID (n = 761). Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced among treatment groups. Throughout the 2-year studies, the total number of relapses treated with methylprednisolone was 402, 221, and 209 in the placebo, DMF BID, and DMF TID groups, respectively. A smaller proportion of patients in the DMF BID (168 of 769 [21.8%]) and DMF TID (151 of 761 [19.8%]) groups experienced ?1 relapse requiring IV steroids compared with the placebo group (284 of 771 [36.8%]). The total number of MS-related hospitalizations over 2 years was 136, 94, and 74 in the placebo, DMF BID, and DMF TID groups. A smaller proportion of patients in the DMF BID (73 of 769 [9.5%]) and DMF TID (57 of 761 [7.5%]) groups had ?1 MS-related hospitalization compared with the placebo group (104 of 771 [13.5%]).IMPLICATIONS: DMF is an effective and well tolerated therapy for RRMS. In addition to clinical benefits, the use of DMF may be associated with reduced patient burden and health economic savings, resulting from a decrease in resource utilization associated with relapses.

Synaptic pathology and denervation of target muscle fibers has been reported prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms in mouse models of both diseases, suggesting that neuromuscular junctions are highly vulnerable from the very early stages, and are a key target for therapeutic intervention. Here we examined neuromuscular pathology longitudinally in three clinically relevant muscle groups in mouse models of ALS and SMA in order to assess their relative vulnerabilities. We show for the first time that neuromuscular junctions of the extraocular muscles (responsible for the control of eye movement) were resistant to degeneration in endstage SMA mice, as well as in late symptomatic ALS mice. Tongue muscle neuromuscular junctions were also spared in both animal models. Conversely, neuromuscular junctions of the lumbrical muscles of the hind-paw were vulnerable in both SMA and ALS, with a loss of neuronal innervation and shrinkage of motor endplates in both diseases. Thus, the pattern of selective vulnerability was conserved across these two models of motor neuron disease. However, the first evidence of neuromuscular pathology occurred at different timepoints of disease progression, with much earlier evidence of presynaptic involvement in ALS, progressing to changes on the postsynaptic side. Conversely, in SMA changes appeared concomitantly at the neuromuscular junction, suggesting that mechanisms of neuromuscular disruption are distinct in these diseases. J. Comp.

      "abstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Despite cooling, adverse outcomes are seen in up to half of the surviving infants after neonatal encephalopathy. A number of novel adjunct drug therapies with cooling have been shown to be highly neuroprotective in animal studies, and are currently awaiting clinical translation. Rigorous evaluation of these therapies in phase II trials using surrogate MR biomarkers may speed up their bench to bedside translation. A recent systematic review of single-centre studies has suggested that MR spectroscopy biomarkers offer the best promise; however, the prognostic accuracy of these biomarkers in cooled encephalopathic babies in a multicentre setting using different MR scan makers is not known.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The MR scanners (3 T; Philips, Siemens, GE) in all the participating sites will be harmonised using phantom experiments and healthy adult volunteers before the start of the study. We will then recruit 180 encephalopathic infants treated with whole body cooling from the participating centres. MRI and spectroscopy will be performed within 2 weeks of birth. Neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed at 18-24 months of age. Agreement between MR cerebral biomarkers and neurodevelopmental outcome will be reported. The sample size is calculated using the 'rule of 10', generally used to calculate the sample size requirements for developing prognostic models. Considering 9 parameters, we require 9?10 adverse events, which suggest that a total sample size of 180 is required.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Human Research Ethics Committee approvals have been received from Brent Research Ethics Committee (London), and from Imperial College London (Sponsor). We will submit the results of the study to relevant journals and offer national and international presentations.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinical Trials.gov Number: NCT01309711.",

Deficiency of the acetylcholine receptor gene CHRNA7 and the partial duplication, CHRFAM7A, may contribute to these phenotypes and we sought to comprehensively analyze these genes in genetic generalized epilepsy. We analyzed using DHPLC, Sanger sequencing and long range PCR, 174 probands with genetic generalized epilepsy with or without intellectual disability or psychosis, including 8 with the recurrent 15q13.3 microdeletion. We searched CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A for single sequence variants, small copy number variants, and the common 2-bp deletion in CHRFAM7A. We identified two novel and one reported missense variants. The common 2-bp deletion was not enriched in patients compared to controls. Our data suggest that missense mutations in CHRNA7 contribute to complex inheritance in genetic generalized epilepsy in a similar fashion to the 15q13.3 microdeletion. They do not support a pathogenic role for the common 2-bp CHRFAM7A deletion.",

We present the first case of successful multiple EGS in a patient with brain ischemic disease who presented with different cerebrovascular findings from MMD.METHODS: A 13-year-old girl had an increased frequency of transient ischemic attacks that affected her right extremities. Digital subtraction angiography showed tapering of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) were visible on vertebral angiogram, but not on carotid angiogram. The intact circle of Willis and lack of hypervascularity of the lenticulostriate arteries were observed. Decreased regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the bilateral ACA and MCA territories quantified by (123)I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single photon emission computed tomography indicated the need for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery. Multiple EGS procedures were performed instead of direct anastomosis, which is the standard procedure for intracranial ICA stenosis, because the space for the craniotomy was limited by transdural anastomosis.RESULTS: Despite the fact that the diagnosis of MMD was questionable, the hemispheres were well vascularized, and the neurology and CBF improved postoperatively.CONCLUSION: The preserved circle of Willis and lack of moyamoya vessels were inconsistent with the features of MMD. However, childhood onset, bilateralness, chronic intracranial ICA stenosis, and transdural anastomosis indicated the same underling pathogenicity as MMD. It is hypothesized that ICA stenosis occurred immediately proximal to the posterior communicating artery in this case. This would have produced the atypical finding of the remaining circle of Willis without growth of the basal moyamoya vessels.",

Mean follow-up was 80 months (IQR 32-85 months). Using multivariable regression models we analyzed the impact of CIAD (defined as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma bronchiale) on stroke severity and outcome.RESULTS: Co-existing CIAD was evident in 7.1 % (n = 72) of all patients with acute ischemic stroke. Baseline characteristics of stroke patients with CIAD did not differ significantly from ischemic stroke patients without CIAD. Age (OR 1.17 [95 % CI 1.03-1.37] per decade), atrial fibrillation (OR 3.43 [95 % CI 2.47-4.78]) and coronary artery disease (OR 1.51 [95 % CI 1.07-2.14]) but not a history of CIAD (p = 0.30) were associated with severe stroke (NIHSS?11) on hospital admission. Age (HR 1.70 [95 % CI 1.53-1.87] per decade), peripheral artery disease (HR 1.91 [95 % CI 1.35-2.7]), stroke severity at hospital admission (NIHSS per point HR 1.08 [95 % CI 1.06-1.10]), and history of CIAD (HR 1.43 [95 % CI 1.02-2.00]) were independently associated with mortality during long-term follow-up. However, CIAD was not significantly associated with short-term mortality after stroke.CONCLUSION: Co-existing CIAD showed no significant association with stroke severity at hospital admission and early mortality after ischemic stroke. CIAD was negatively associated with long-term survival after ischemic stroke.",

The aim of this study was to compare the different characteristics of triggers among the most common primary headache subtypes (migraine without aura, migraine with aura and tension type headache).METHODS: A total of 116 headache patients of the neurology outpatient department of a tertiary hospital in Athens were selected according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headaches-3nd Edition Beta. Patients were interviewed using a questionnaire that contained 35 potential trigger factors.RESULTS: The findings showed that migraine and tension-type headache patients report multiple triggers, on a frequent but variable basis. The most frequent triggers reported by all subjects were stressful life events followed by intense emotions. The same applies to both genders, as well as the three headache subgroups. Patients suffering from migraine with aura reported the highest mean number of trigger per person and the highest frequency in almost all the trigger categories. Furthermore, patients with migraine with aura were more likely to report the following triggers: oversleeping, premenstrual period, stressful life events, hot/cold weather, relaxation after stress, menstruation, wind, intense emotions, shining, hunger and bright sunlight. These associations were mostly independent of the sociodemographic characteristics and the presence of anxiety or depressive symptoms.CONCLUSION: The sensitivity to trigger factors should be considered by both clinicians and headache sufferers.",

Members of the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) were surveyed. Respondents were presented 32 diseases with neuroimaging findings and asked which ones medical students should be exposed to during a neuroradiology rotation. Using a 50% response threshold per disease entity, results were tabulated into 3 groups: diagnoses that (1) more than 50% of neuroradiologists and neurologists felt medical students should see radiologically by rotation completion, (2) less than 50% of respondents in both the groups felt were important, and (3) both the groups disagree are important. Both the groups thought medical students should be exposed to imaging of intraparenchymal hemorrhage (ASNR = 80.4% vs AAN = 84.3%; P = 0.346) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (ASNR = 74% vs AAN = 78%; P = 0.394). Both the groups (>50%) thought subdural hematoma, acute ischemic stroke, epidural hematoma, and spinal cord compression are important. Conditions such as spine fractures, nonacute stroke, arteriovenous malformation, and ear-nose-throat pathology showed varied results between both the groups. Varying degrees of similarity and differences exist between the expectations of neuroradiologists and neurologists regarding medical student neuroradiology education, presenting a positive opportunity for greater consensus, dialogue, and joint curriculum formation.

There is no comprehensive resource describing their health systems, access to specialty care, antiepileptic drug (AED) use, and availability of brain imaging and EEG. The purpose of this study was to profile epilepsy care in these countries as an initial step toward improving the standard of care and identifying gaps in care to guide future policy changes. In each southern Caribbean country, we conducted study visits and interviewed health-care providers, government health ministers, pharmacy directors, hospital medical directors, pharmacists, clinic staff, radiologists, and radiology and EEG technicians. Health-care providers completed extensive epilepsy care surveys. The five countries all have integrated government health systems with clinics and hospitals that provide free or heavily subsidized care and AEDs for patients with epilepsy. Only Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, however, have neurology specialists. The three smaller countries lack government imaging and EEG facilities. Trinidad had up to one-year waits for public MRI/EEG. Government formularies in Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Saint Lucia are limited to first-generation AEDs. One or more second-line agents are formulary in Trinidad and Barbados. Nonformulary drugs may be obtained for individual patients in Barbados. Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines participate in an Organization of Eastern Caribbean States formulary purchasing system, which added levetiracetam following the survey. Newer generic AED formulations with the lowest risks for pregnancy malformation were not in use. In conclusion, patients with epilepsy in the southern Caribbean have excellent access to government clinics and hospitals, but AED choices are limited. Local medical providers reported that the major limitations in care were lack of specialty care, lack of imaging and EEG services, financial barriers to care, long wait times for care, and limited access to additional AEDs.

The lack of reliable disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures for use in clinical trials prompted the development of the Neurology Quality of Life (Neuro-QOL) instrument, which includes 13 scales that assess physical, emotional, cognitive, and social domains, for use in a variety of neurological illnesses.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research paper is to conduct an initial assessment of the reliability and validation of the Neuro-QOL short forms (SFs) in MS.METHODS: We assessed reliability, concurrent validity, known groups validity, and responsiveness between cross-sectional and longitudinal data in 161 recruited MS patients.RESULTS: Internal consistency was high for all measures (á = 0.81-0.95) and ICCs were within the acceptable range (0.76-0.91); concurrent and known groups validity were highest with the Global HRQL question. Longitudinal assessment was limited by the lack of disease progression in the group.CONCLUSIONS: The Neuro-QOL SFs demonstrate good internal consistency, test-re-test reliability, and concurrent and known groups validity in this MS population, supporting the validity of Neuro-QOL in adults with MS.",

We aimed at establishing predictors of early ND (END) as well as late ND (LND) and at exploring the impact of neurological stability during the first week on long-term prognosis.DESIGN: We conducted this study as a retrospective cohort study. ND was evaluated based on the consciousness and severity of neurological symptoms. ND during the first 24 h after admission was defined as early ND and from 24 h to 7 days as LND. Patients were followed up until February 2015.PARTICIPANTS: We included 300 patients with acute ICH (?4.5 h from symptom onset) who were admitted to our institution from March 2009 to January 2015.SETTING: Section of Acute Neurology, Department of Neurology, Bispebjerg Hospital is a specialised referral centre receiving patients with acute stroke from the entire capital region of Denmark.RESULTS: We found that a spot sign on CT angiography (OR 10.7 CI 4.79 to 24.3) and extensive degree of interventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (OR 8.73 CI 2.87 to 26.5) were independent predictors of END, whereas a degree of comorbidity (Charlton Index), admission stroke severity and degree of IVH predicted LND. On follow-up imaging, haematoma expansion was independently associated with END (OR 6.1 CI 2.2 to 17.3), and expansion of IVH was independently associated with both END (OR 1.7 CI 1.2 to 2.3 per point increase) and LND (OR 2.3 CI 1.3 to 4.2 per point increase). ND during the first week was associated with a 1-year mortality of 60.5%, compared with 9.2% among the patients who remained stable.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that stability during the first week entails an optimistic prognosis. A relatively easy and effective risk stratification of END and LND is possible on admission based on the spot sign, IVH and clinical parameters.",

The study objective was to use statistical models to identify combinations of discrete parameters from the patient signalment, history and neurological examination that could suggest the most likely diagnoses with statistical significance. A retrospective study of 500 dogs referred to the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals before June 2012 for the investigation of spinal disease was performed. Details regarding signalment, history, physical and neurological examinations, neuroanatomical localisation and imaging data were obtained. Univariate analyses of variables (breed, age, weight, onset, deterioration, pain, asymmetry, neuroanatomical localisation) were performed, and variables were retained in a multivariate logistic regression model if P<0.05. Leading diagnoses were intervertebral disc extrusion (IVDE, n=149), intervertebral disc protrusion (n=149), ischaemic myelopathy (IM, n=48) and neoplasms (n=44). Multivariate logistic regression characterised IM and acute non-compressive nucleus pulposus extrusions as the only peracute onset, non-progressive, non-painful and asymmetrical T3-L3 myelopathies. IVDE was most commonly characterised as acute onset, often deteriorating, painful and largely symmetrical T3-L3 myelopathy. This study suggests that most spinal diseases cause distinctive combinations of presenting clinical parameters (signalment, onset, deterioration, pain, asymmetry, neuroanatomical localisation). Taking particular account of these parameters may aid decision making in a clinical setting. ",

A representative selection of tractography methods were compared to manganese tracing on a voxel-wise basis, and a more qualitative assessment examined whether, and to what extent, certain fiber tracts and gray matter targets were reached. While the voxel-wise agreement was very limited, qualitative assessment revealed that tractography is capable of finding the major fiber tracts, although there were some differences between the methods. However, false positive connections were very common and, in particular, we discovered that it is not possible to achieve high sensitivity (i.e., few false negatives) and high specificity (i.e., few false positives) at the same time. Closer inspection of the results led to the conclusion that these problems mainly originate from regions with complex fiber arrangements or high curvature and are not easily resolved by sophisticated local models alone. Instead, the crucial challenge in making tractography a truly useful and reliable tool in brain research and neurology lies in the acquisition of better data. In particular, the increase of spatial resolution, under preservation of the signal-to-noise-ratio, is key.",

The diagnostic work-up included neurological examination, standard EEG, and MRI. The degree of concordance of the seizure semiology, EEG, and neuroimaging was used to determine the potential candidates for surgery. The probability of seizure freedom rate was estimated based on known predictive values of anatomical, electrophysiological, and semiological characteristics.RESULTS: A total of 83 (25 %) patients met the criteria of PRE. Fourteen (17 %) patients had complete concordance of seizure semiology, MRI, and EEG. Out of these patients, 11 had mesial temporal sclerosis on MRI and three had focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Estimated seizure-free surgical success rate in this group was 75-95 % without the need for further investigations. Out of 25 (30 %) non-lesional MRI cases, the concordance of seizure semiology and EEG was in nine patients with probable success rate up to 60 %. Thirteen patients (16 %) had discordant EEG and MRI data and were not suitable for surgery without further testing.CONCLUSIONS: A significant portion of PRE patients with concordant anatomical, electrophysiological, and semiological characteristics can be treated surgically in resource-limited countries. Nevertheless, most patients will still require further investigation for proper localization of epileptogenic focus.",

These symptoms can have long-term adverse impacts on parent mental health, family functioning, and the adjustment of the ill child. Independent studies have found such reactions in several different illness groups. However, very little research has systematically compared the prevalence, impact and trajectories over time of post-traumatic stress symptoms in parents across different childhood illness groups with an acute life threat. The current study seeks to map the course of post-traumatic stress reactions in parents of children with various life threatening illnesses over an 18 month period, and identify factors that predict successful adaptation in families.METHOD/DESIGN: The current study described is of a prospective, longitudinal design. The sample included parents of children admitted to four major hospital departments at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, for a life threatening illness or injury. Eligible parents were those who were caregivers of children aged 0-to 18-years admitted to the Oncology, Cardiology, Neurology and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Parents were recruited acutely, and completed self-report questionnaires at four time-points: within the first 4 weeks (T1:); then at 4 months (T2); 7 months (T3); and 19 months (T4) after admission. Questionnaires assessed parent and child mental health and wellbeing, and a number of risk and reliance factors such child illness factors, parent demographic factors, and psychosocial factors.DISCUSSION: This study is one of the first to document the trajectory of post-traumatic stress responses in parents of very ill children, across illness groups. Given that it will also identify risk and resilience factors, and map the course of parent outcomes over an 18 monthperiod, it has the potential to inform novel strategies for intervention.",

A 59-year-old man presented to the Department of Neurology with bizarre behavior, memory loss, cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, and myoclonus and facio-brachial dystonic seizures. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no hippocampal lesions. Blood tests showed hyponatremia. An electroencephalogram showed disorganization and slowing of background activity. Antiepileptic drugs were ineffective. The patient exhibited considerable improvement following immunotherapy. The diagnosis of limbic encephalitis associated with LGI1 antibodies should be considered in patients with clinical manifestations mimicking psychiatric disorders and in cases of refractory epilepsy especially with faciobrachial dystonic seizures. There is frequently hyponatremia, and cerebral MRI may be normal. Full recovery can be expected with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. ",

The study group was further divided into newly diagnosed celiac disease patients (n = 216) and patients who were on a gluten-free diet (n = 91) for at least 6 months. Medical histories of all children including age, sex, symptoms, weight, height, physical examination findings, and laboratory data were recorded. All patients underwent an electroencephalograph in a pediatric neurology electroencephalograph laboratory with a 32-channel electroencephalograph for 30 minutes.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were defined to have epileptiform discharges (spike/sharp-wave discharges); 24 (7.8%) of those patients were in the celiac disease group and 1 (0.5%) was in the control group (P = 0.001). Among those 24 patients, 21 (9.7%) were in newly diagnosed celiac disease group and 3 (3.3%) were in the gluten-free diet group (P = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with celiac disease are prone to epileptiform activities on electroencephalography and should be evaluated carefully. Moreover, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet early should be advised in those patients with epileptiform activities because it may effectively decrease the occurrence of epileptiform activities.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in- fluence of air pollution and seasonal climate factors of any on number of relapses in MS patients during a consecutive 5 years of observation.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of MS patients from the town of Ni?, hospitalized at the Clinic of Neurology, Clinical Center Ni?, Serbia, from 2005 to 2009. Climate data: mean daily sun shining; mean monthly sun shining, mean whole daily cloudiness, daily cloudiness at 7 a.m, 2 p.m. and 9 p.m. and air pollution expressed by NSR (New Source Review) were obtained from the Meteorology Observatory Ni?.RESULTS: During a 5-year of observation there were 260 relapses in 101 MS patients. The number of relapses showed a significantly negative correlation with the number of days with NSR < 2 (p = -0.31; p < 0.01) and a positive correlation with the mean whole daily cloudiness (p < 0.05), mean daily cloudiness at 7 a.m. (p < 0.05) and 2 p.m. (p < 0.01). We found a significantlly positive correlation (p < 0.05) between the reduced number of relapses during the period of high vitamin D season, i.e. July-October. There was a statistically significant increase (p < 0.01) of the number of relapses during spring (x = 6.53; SD = 3.98) compared to the other three seasons. The joint presence of lower number of days with NSR < 2 during low vitamin D season (January- April) correlated with a statistically significant increase of the number of relapses in MS patients (F = 5.06, p < 0.01). CON- CLUSION: The obtained results confirmed the influence of air pollution and climate seasonal conditions on disease relapses in MS patients based on a long-term observation. Lower numbers of days with low air pollution during the periods with low vitamin D (January-April), especially with increased cloudiness at 2 p.m, induce a higher risk of MS relapses in southern continental parts of Europe.",

We determined the incidence of HAD 30 days post-hospitalization and ORs for HAD by age group.MEASUREMENTS: The outcome measure was death or HAD at 30 days after hospital discharge. HAD is defined as a new or additional disability in one or more activities of daily living (ADL) that is present at hospital discharge compared to baseline. Participants' functional status at baseline (2 weeks prior to admission) and 30 days post-discharge was ascertained by self-report of ADL function.RESULTS: Many participants (75.3 %) were functionally independent at baseline. By age group, HAD occurred as follows: 27.4 % in ages 55-59, 22.2 % in ages 60-64, 17.4 % in ages 65-69, 30.3 % in ages 70-79, and 61.7 % in ages 80 or older. Compared to the youngest group, only the adjusted OR for HAD in adults over 80 was significant, at 2.45 (95 % CI 1.17, 5.15).CONCLUSIONS: In adults at a safety-net hospital, HAD occurred in similar proportions among adults aged 55-59 and those aged 70-79, and was highest in the oldest adults, aged ? 80. In safety-net hospitals, interventions to reduce HAD among patients 70 years and older should consider expanding age criteria to adults as young as 55.",

Cardiac dysfunction after stroke is a challenge for clinicians. This is a retrospective study of patients in the neurology departments of 23 hospitals in Shanghai and Wuhan, China.METHODS: The medical records of 351 patients were compared. Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U tests, and stratification compared subgroups. Logistic regressions analyzed factors associated with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score.RESULTS: ECG abnormalities occurred in 70.1% of patients at an early stage (most were within 48 hours of disease onset) at least once, whereas 45.9% of the patients had ECG abnormalities within 48 hours of onset and at 7 days after onset. The incidence of poor prognosis (mRS >1) was significantly higher in the patients with ECG abnormalities for both time points than that in those with normal ECGs (56.3% versus 32%, odds ratio = 2.166). Most patients demonstrated 1 to 2 ECG abnormalities, and very few patients had 3 or more. Increasing number of ECG abnormalities was mirrored by poorer prognosis. ECG abnormalities occurred within 48 hours and at the seventh day after onset of acute ischemic stroke; the abnormalities that appeared within 48 hours and were still found on the seventh day after onset of the disease were independent predictors of poor patient prognosis.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of abnormal ECGs was high in the patients with acute ischemic stroke, and the abnormal ECGs could appear at any stage of the disease.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the level of agreement between vets (both neurology specialists and non-specialists) on the description and classification of videos depicting paroxysmal events, without knowing any results of diagnostic workup. An online questionnaire study was conducted, where participants watched 100 videos of dogs and cats exhibiting paroxysmal events and answered questions regarding: epileptic seizure presence (yes/no), seizure type, consciousness status, and the presence of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioural signs. Agreement statistics (percentage agreement and kappa) calculated for each variable, with prevalence indices calculated to aid their interpretation.RESULTS: Only a fair level of agreement (ê = 0.40) was found for epileptic seizure presence. Overall agreement of seizure type was moderate (ê = 0.44), with primary generalised seizures showing the highest level of agreement (ê = 0.60), and focal the lowest (ê =0.31). Fair agreement was found for consciousness status and the presence of autonomic signs (ê = 0.21-0.40), but poor agreement for neurobehavioral signs (ê = 0.16). Agreement for motor signs ranged from poor (ê = ? 0.20) to moderate (ê = 0.41-0.60). Differences between specialists and non-specialists were identified.CONCLUSIONS: The relatively low levels of agreement described here highlight the need for further discussions between neurology experts regarding classifying and describing epileptic seizures, and additional training of non-specialists to facilitate accurate diagnosis. There is a need for diagnostic tools (e.g. electroencephalogram) able to differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysms.",

In this study we evaluated the relationship between HLA-DRB1 genotype, which has been proved to be more common in Iranian MS patients, and clinical response to interferon-beta (IFNâ), which is the most common immunotherapy for relapsing-remitting MS.DESIGN AND SETTING: In this study 68 Iranian patients with confirmed diagnosis of RRMS who had been referred to and admitted in Neurology Department of Amiralam and Khatam Hospitals in Tehran were selected. Patients were followed prospectively for 2 years since initiation of therapy and clinical data, including EDSS scores were recorded every 3 months. MRI was performed at the time of diagnosis and each year.METHODS: HLA-DRB1 typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for all patients and data was analyzed by STATA 12th edition.RESULTS: There were 47 (69.1%) responders and 21 (30.9%) non-responders. These two groups were demographically and clinically comparable. Fisher's exact test did not show any difference between HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies in responders and non-responders.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the lack of association between HLA-DRB1 and clinical response to IFNâ among MS patients as previous studies had done.",

Indeed, liver autoimmunity and the autoimmune diseases associated with both innate and adaptive responses to hepatocytes and/or cholangiocytes are models of human autoimmunity. For example, in primary biliary cirrhosis, there exists a well-defined and characteristic autoantibody and considerable homogeneity between patients. In autoimmune hepatitis, there are clinical characteristics that allow a rigorous subset definition and well-defined inflammatory infiltrates. In both cases, there are defects in a variety of immune pathways and including regulatory cells. In primary sclerosing cholangitis, with its characteristic overlap with inflammatory bowel disease, there are unique defects in innate immunity and particular important contribution of lymphoid homing to disease pathogenesis. In these diseases, as with other human autoimmune processes, there is the critical understanding that pathogenesis requires a genetic background, but is determined by environmental features, and indeed the concordance of these diseases in identical twins highlights the stochastic nature of immunopathology. Unfortunately, despite major advances in basic immunology and in immunopathology in these diseases, there remains a major void in therapy. The newer biologics that are so widely used in rheumatology, neurology, and gastroenterology have not yet seen success in autoimmune liver disease. Future efforts will depend on more rigorous molecular biology and systems analysis in order for successful application to be made to patients. ",

The score is increasingly used for risk stratification of TIA patients, but little is known about its inter-rater reliability. The aim of the present study was to prospectively assess the inter-rater reliability of the ABCD(2) score in patients with TIA, including a comparison among raters of different specialties.METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department with TIA within 48 hours of onset were prospectively evaluated. TIA was defined as acute onset of focal cerebral or monocular symptoms lasting less than 24 hours and presumed because of a vascular cause. Only patients who were asymptomatic at the time of enrollment were eligible. ABCD(2) scores determined by raters of different specialties were compared with those of a vascular neurology attending. Estimated component and total scores and ABCD(2) risk category were compared between raters. Reliability was assessed using unweighted kappa statistics.RESULTS: A total of 362 evaluations resulting in ABCD(2) scores were performed. In addition to the vascular neurology attending, scores were generated by internal medicine (n = 72), emergency medicine (n = 37), and neurology junior (n = 92) and senior (n = 57) residents. Based on attending scores, 35% of patients were categorized as low risk (ABCD(2) score, 0-3), 50% as moderate risk (ABCD(2) score, 4-5), and 16% as high risk (ABCD(2) score, 6-7). Inter-rater reliability was fair for ABCD(2) total score (ê = .26) and category (ê = .29). Raters agreed with the vascular neurology attending 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61%-73%) of the time for ABCD(2) category and 52% (95% CI, 46%-58%) of the time for ABCD(2) total score. Disagreement more often resulted in a lower score by the raters as compared with the vascular neurology attending for both ABCD(2) total score and category. Inter-rater reliability of component scores was near perfect for age (ê = .95) and diabetes (ê = .81) and substantial for blood pressure (ê = .67), but only moderate for clinical features (ê = .55) and duration (ê = .48).CONCLUSIONS: The inter-rater reliability of the ABCD(2) score is only fair, with rater disagreement of ABCD(2) risk category in nearly one third of patients.",

Imported supplements and chemical reagents were used by 64% and 29% of melatonin prescribers, respectively. Some prescribed melatonin without patient consent or institutional approval. In patients with pervasive developmental disorder, cerebral palsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Rett syndrome, and visual disturbance, melatonin was prescribed by 37%, 29%, 10%, 6%, and 6% of the respondents, respectively. In terms of sleep disorders, melatonin was prescribed by 49% and 42% of respondents in patients with circadian rhythm disorders and insomnia, respectively. Ramelteon was prescribed by 52% of respondents. Regarding types of target diseases and sleep disorders, the use of ramelteon differed little from that of melatonin. In the second phase of the survey on the use of melatonin, 23 doctors prescribed the drug for 254 patients. The daily effective dose ranged from 0.2 mg to 8 mg in patients aged 2 months to 37 years. In more than 60% of the patients who took melatonin, PDD was diagnosed. In the patients with melatonin for insomnia, 90% and 25% had difficulty falling asleep and disorders in circadian rhythm, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Both melatonin and ramelteon were widely prescribedin Japanese children. Melatonin tended to be used without sufficient ethical consideration in Japan, indicating the necessity of melatonin as medicine. Then, careful determination of an applicable dose are required in future studies.",

This article argues that this development should prompt a new focus in medical care. The key questions should not only be how can we improve treatment of age-related disorders but also how can we prevent age-related disorders in the first place or at least substantially delay their onset? These questions touch on an even more profound question: how can successful aging be accomplished? That is, which factors and processes characterize successful aging both on a system and on a molecular level? Thus, the crucial societal, scientific and medical challenges for Western societies are to develop and implement measures of primary prevention of dysfunctional aging. The disease-centered framework which currently determines most clinical thinking, scientific research and third party funding has to be supplemented by a novel framework of successful aging. This article defines dysfunctional aging as a convergent downstream result of multiple interacting system processes. Each of these detrimental system processes must be targeted by specific measures of geriatric primary prevention. This, in turn, implies that geriatrics does not start in the elderly or with the onset of particular geriatric disorders. Instead, it starts in the daily practice of neurology and other medical disciplines taking care of persons aged 20-40 years who are largely healthy and in the middle of their professional and personal career. Or, in a nutshell, geriatrics starts right in the middle of medical care. ",

We recorded demographic, anthropometric, and clinical information, and the level of training of the resident performing the procedure. Outcomes measure was unsuccessful LP, defined as no quantifiable CSF. This study was previously approved by the University of Iowa institutional review board.RESULTS: A total of 328 patients (59% women) were included. Men were significantly older than women, and the indication of the procedure differed by sex. Headache or possible multiple sclerosis were more common indications in women than in men. Nineteen percent of the LPs were unsuccessful. We found a strong correlation between patient body mass index (BMI) and unsuccessful outcome (p < 0.0001). Age of the patient and level of training of the operator did not predict unsuccessful LP.CONCLUSIONS: Patient BMI is the key factor that determines an unsuccessful LP by neurology residents in an outpatient setting, an association that might be applicable to different clinical settings. The high failure rate in patients with BMI >35 suggests that implementing compensatory interventions such as the use of imaging guidance might be cost-effective and better tolerated by these patients.",

Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2, CNTNAP2) is a known genetic risk factor of autism. However, how this protein might contribute to pathology is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Caspr2 is abundantly present in lipid raft and in the synaptic membrane but is highly depleted in the postsynaptic density. The Caspr2 protein level in hippocampus is present at a constant level during synapse formation and myelination from P0 to P84. Interaction proteomics revealed the interactors of Caspr2, including CNTN2, KCNAs, members of the ADAM family (ADAM22, ADAM23 and ADAM11), members of LGI family and MAGUKs (DLGs and MPPs). Interestingly, a short form of Caspr2 was detected, which lacks most of the extracellular domains, however, is still associated with ADAM22 and to a lesser extent LGI1 and Kv1 channels. The comprehensive Caspr2 interactome revealed here might aid in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying autism.

In some observational studies it has been associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. Both antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulant drugs are used to reduce risk of stroke but whether one treatment strategy is more effective than the other is unknown. We compared their efficacy in the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS), with the additional aim of establishing the true risk of recurrent stroke.METHODS: We did this randomised trial at hospitals with specialised stroke or neurology services (39 in the UK and seven in Australia). We included patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an automated telephone randomisation service to receive antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulant drugs (specific treatment decided by the local clinician) for 3 months. Patients and clinicians were not masked to allocation, but investigators assessing endpoints were. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral stroke or death in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with EUDract (2006-002827-18) and ISRN (CTN44555237).FINDINGS: We enrolled 250 participants (118 carotid, 132 vertebral). Mean time to randomisation was 3·65 days (SD 1·91). The major presenting symptoms were stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n=224) and local symptoms (headache, neck pain, or Horner's syndrome; n=26). 126 participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment versus 124 to anticoagulant treatment. Overall, four (2%) of 250 patients had stroke recurrence (all ipsilateral). Stroke or death occurred in three (2%) of 126 patients versus one (1%) of 124 (odds ratio [OR] 0·335, 95% CI 0·006-4·233; p=0·63). There were no deaths, but one major bleeding (subarachnoid haemorrhage) in the anticoagulant group. Central review of imaging failed to confirm dissection in 52 patients. Preplanned per-protocol analysis excluding these patients showed stroke or death in three (3%) of 101 patients in the antiplatelet group versus one (1%) of 96 patients in the anticoagulant group (OR 0·346, 95% CI 0·006-4·390; p=0·66).INTERPRETATION: We found no difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs at preventing stroke and death in patients with symptomatic carotid and vertebral artery dissection but stroke was rare in both groups, and much rarer than reported in some observational studies. Diagnosis of dissection was not confirmed after review in many cases, suggesting that radiographic criteria are not always correctly applied in routine clinical practice.FUNDING: Stroke Association.",

There are very few studies of 6CIT performance in secondary care settings.METHODS: We undertook a pragmatic diagnostic accuracy study of 6CIT in consecutive patients referred over the course of one year to a neurology-led cognitive function clinic, and compared its performance for the diagnosis of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to that of the simultaneously administered Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: In a cohort of 245 patients with dementia prevalence around 20%, 6CIT proved quick and easy to use and acceptable to patients. It had good sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.78) for dementia diagnosis; it was more sensitive than MMSE (0.59) but less specific (0.85). For MCI diagnosis, 6CIT was again more sensitive (0.66) than MMSE (0.51) but less specific (0.70 vs. 0.75). Weighted comparisons showed net benefit for 6CIT compared to MMSE for both dementia and MCI diagnosis. 6CIT effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large for dementia diagnosis and moderate for MCI diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: 6CIT is an acceptable and accurate test for the assessment of cognitive problems, its performance being more sensitive than the MMSE. 6CIT use should be considered as a viable alternative to MMSE in the secondary care setting.",

Evaluation of current patient knowledge regarding oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) is the first step in improving the quality of anticoagulation therapy and patient care. The aim of the present study was to assess the knowledge regarding OAT among patients with stroke and those at high risk of thromboembolic events in a tertiary care hospital in India.METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used; 240 patients on OAT because of various indications (mechanical heart valve replacement, rheumatic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and stroke) attending the neurology and cardiology outpatient clinics and inpatient services were recruited. A structured self-developed questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge in these patients.RESULTS: Most patients (62.9%) were ignorant about the target prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) levels with only 30% having their recent INR within the target range; 50% of the patients had a poor knowledge score, and the knowledge gap was most prominent in the domains of dietary interactions followed by drug interactions, adverse effects, and PT/INR monitoring. Knowledge score also had a significant association with gender, education, monthly income, and place of residence (P < .05).CONCLUSION: Patient's knowledge about OAT was suboptimal. The findings support the need for educational interventions to improve the knowledge regarding OAT and, thereby, achieve an appropriate and safe secondary prevention of stroke.",

One promising way to approach this is to develop minimally invasive tests for the sensitive and specific detection of biomarkers in blood. Irrespective of the detection approach one uses, this remains a challenging task because biomarkers are typically present in low concentrations and there are signals that interfere strongly with prevailing compounds of human fluids. In this paper, we show that elemental encoded particle assay coupled with femtosecond laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy for simultaneous multi-elemental analysis can significantly improve biomarker detectability. An estimated near single molecule per particle efficiency of this method leads to sensitive detection of ovarian cancer biomarker CA125 in human blood plasma. This work opens new ways for earlier detection of cancers and for multiplex assay developments in various analytical applications from proteomics, genomics, and neurology fields. ",

Recently, the prognosis of POEMS was substantially improved by introduction of therapeutic intervention for myeloma. However, no randomised clinical trial has been performed because of the rarity and severity of the disease.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Japanese POEMS syndrome with Thalidomide (J-POST) Trial is a phase II/III multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with thalidomide in POEMS syndrome, with an additional 48-week open-label safety study. Adults with POEMS syndrome who have no indication for transplantation are assessed for eligibility at 12 tertiary neurology centres in Japan. Patients who satisfy the eligibility criteria are randomised (1:1) to receive thalidomide (100-300 mg daily) plus dexamethasone (12 mg/m(2) on days 1-4 of a 28-day cycle) or placebo plus dexamethasone. Both treatments were administered for 24 weeks (six cycles; randomised comparative study period). Patients who complete the randomised study period or show subacute deterioration during the randomised period participate in the subsequent 48-week open-label safety study (long-term safety period). The primary end point of the study is the reduction rate of serum VEGF levels at 24 weeks.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each hospital. The trial was notified and registered at the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, Japan (No. 22-1716). The J-POST Trial is currently ongoing and is due to finish in August 2015. The findings of this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations and will also be disseminated to participants.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000004179 and JMA-IIA00046.",

Only 2 new cases of malignancy were diagnosed after gAChR-Ab detection. The non-AAG group was associated with high frequencies of neurological and non-neurological autoimmunity, but also included 23 (31%) patients with mostly degenerative disorders.CONCLUSION: Detection of gAChR-Ab, especially at a higher level, is helpful for the diagnosis of AAG in patients with corresponding autonomic symptoms. However, its value is limited for predicting cancer risk and for diagnosis and management of patients without autonomic symptoms.",

The data showing the efficacy of Ig therapy in conditions such as chronic pain and autoimmune encephalitis are promising. Future challenges for Ig use in neurological disorders were also outlined. Ongoing and upcoming randomized controlled trials will be pivotal to the use of Ig in the future, by identifying responder groups and elucidating the most effective administration practices. As our understanding and use of the therapy increases, it is essential that we collect data on the effects of long-term Ig treatment in neurological conditions, of which very little currently exists.

Existence of mood disorders alters the patients' life quality.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of depression in MS and establish the relationship between the severity of the disease, the onset of depression and their correlation with neuroimaging.METHODS: Fifty patients with MS aged 20 to 50 years followed at the Neurology Department of Charles-Nicolle Hospital from 2008 to 2012 participated in this study. The evaluation included a neuropsychological assessment, physical examination with EDSS and MRI.RESULTS: Association between MS and depression is common and known. In our study, prevalence of depression was 65%. Coexistence of other psychiatric disorders was found in around 10% of patients. Mood disorder was inaugural in some cases and delayed in others. This suggests that depression in MS may be linked to the disease or a result of a functional disability process. Occurrence of depression was not directly related to disease severity in all cases studied.CONCLUSION: Depression is a possible manifestation of MS. This mood disorder is due to the demyelinating brain damage or to a genetic susceptibility. However, a fortuitous association cannot be excluded.",

We present a case of steroid-dependent auditory neuropathy associated with CMT, in which the patient experienced 3 episodes of acute exacerbation of hearing loss and successful rescue of hearing by prednisolone. An 8-year-old boy was referred to the otolaryngology department at the University Hospital. He had been diagnosed with CMT type 1 (demyelinating type) at the Child Neurology Department and was suffering from mild hearing loss due to auditory neuropathy. An audiological diagnosis of auditory neuropathy was confirmed by auditory brainstem response and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. At 9 years and 0 months old, 9 years and 2 months old, and 10 years and 0 months old, he had experienced acute exacerbations of hearing loss, each of which was successfully rescued by intravenous or oral prednisolone within 2 weeks. Steroid-responsive cases of CMT have been reported, but this is the first case report of steroid-responsive sensorineural hearing loss in CMT. The present case may have implications for the mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids in the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. ",

Neurological examination showed reduced pinprick and absent vibration sensations in the lower limbs. Motor system examination was normal. Her antinuclear antibodies titre was 1:100 with positive Ro antibodies. Her initial nerve conduction studies were normal. However, the lower limb somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) demonstrated impairment of central sensory conduction pathway. Rheumatology review revealed a history of fatigue and Sicca symptoms and her Schirmer's test was strongly positive. This lead to the diagnosis of ganglionopathy associated to Sj?gren's syndrome. She had an excellent response to intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide infusions. This case highlights that dorsal column involvement can precede the diagnosis of primary Sj?gren's syndrome. ",

An all-condition measure may better measure quality and promote innovation.OBJECTIVE: To develop an all-condition, hospital-wide readmission measure.DESIGN: Measure development study.SETTING: 4821 U.S. hospitals.PATIENTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older.MEASUREMENTS: Hospital-level, risk-standardized unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge. The measure uses Medicare fee-for-service claims and is a composite of 5 specialty-based, risk-standardized rates for medicine, surgery/gynecology, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology cohorts. The 2007-2008 admissions were randomly split for development and validation. Models were adjusted for age, principal diagnosis, and comorbid conditions. Calibration in Medicare and all-payer data was examined, and hospital rankings in the development and validation samples were compared.RESULTS: The development data set contained 8 018 949 admissions associated with 1 276 165 unplanned readmissions (15.9%). The median hospital risk-standardized unplanned readmission rate was 15.8 (range, 11.6 to 21.9). The 5 specialty cohort models accurately predicted readmission risk in both Medicare and all-payer data sets for average-risk patients but slightly overestimated readmission risk at the extremes. Overall hospital risk-standardized readmission rates did not differ statistically in the split samples (P = 0.71 for difference in rank), and 76% of hospitals' validation-set rankings were within 2 deciles of the development rank (24% were more than 2 deciles). Of hospitals ranking in the top or bottom deciles, 90% remained within 2 deciles (10% were more than 2 deciles) and 82% remained within 1 decile (18% were more than 1 decile).LIMITATION: Risk adjustment was limited to that available in claims data.CONCLUSION: A claims-based, hospital-wide unplanned readmission measure for profiling hospitals produced reasonably consistent results in different data sets and was similarly calibrated in both Medicare and all-payer data.PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",

Forty-seven centres from 15 European countries participate in sifap1.PARTICIPANTS: 5023 acute patients with stroke (aged 18-55 years) patients (96.5% Caucasians) were enrolled in the study between April 2007 and January 2010.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: sifap1 was originally designed to investigate the relation of juvenile stroke and Fabry disease. A secondary aim of sifap1 was to investigate stroke patterns in this specific group of patients. The present investigation is a secondary analysis addressing stroke presenting symptoms with a special regard to signs included in the FAST scheme.RESULTS: 4535 patients with transient ischaemic attack (TIA; n=1071), ischaemic stroke (n=3396) or other (n=68) were considered in the presented analysis. FAST symptoms could be traced in 76.5% of all cases. 35% of those with at least one FAST symptom had all three symptoms. At least one FAST symptom could be recognised in 69.1% of 18-24 years-old patients, in 74% of those aged 25-34 years, in 75.4% of those aged 35-44 years, and 77.8% in 45-55 years-old patients. With increasing stroke severity signs included in the FAST scheme were more prevalent (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS<5: 69%, NIHSS 6-15: 98.9%, NIHSS>15: 100%). Clustering clinical signs according to FAST lower percentages of strokes in the posterior circulation (65.2%) and in patients with TIA (62.3%) were identified.CONCLUSIONS: FAST may be applied as a useful and rapid tool to identify stroke symptoms in young individuals aged 18-55 years. Especially in patients eligible for thrombolysis FAST might address the majority of individuals.STUDY REGISTRATION: The study was registered in http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (No. NCT00414583).",

Assessing the in vivo connectivity of the claustrum may bring forth useful insights with relevance to model the overall functionality of the claustrum itself. Using structural and diffusion tensor neuroimaging in N = 100 healthy subjects, we found that the claustrum has the highest connectivity in the brain by regional volume. Network theoretical analyses revealed that (a) the claustrum is a primary contributor to global brain network architecture, and that (b) significant connectivity dependencies exist between the claustrum, frontal lobe, and cingulate regions. These results illustrate that the claustrum is ideally located within the human central nervous system (CNS) connectome to serve as the putative \"gate keeper\" of neural information for consciousness awareness. Our findings support and underscore prior theoretical contributions about the involvement of the claustrum in higher cognitive function and its relevance in devastating neurological disease.",

This study aims to describe patients in whom an arachnoid cyst was identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study performed for the evaluation of headache in a pediatric headache clinic and to highlight the clinical dilemma posed by this finding.METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study design was used. The electronic database of a tertiary pediatric headache clinic was searched for all newly admitted patients with headache who underwent MRI evaluation in 2008-2013. The indications for imaging were based on clinical practice parameters recommended by the Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology. Clinical and imaging parameters were collected from the files. Findings were compared between patients with and without an arachnoid cyst.RESULTS: Of the 250 (31%) of 800 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 11 (4.4%) had an arachnoid cyst. Two patients had a ruptured cyst with midline shifting and a large subdural collection. Both presented with headache, vomiting, phonophobia, and photophobia. In the other 9 asymptomtic patients with an arachnoid cyst, imaging showed only a mild mass effect without midline shifting; their symptoms were considered unrelated to the cyst. The patients with a symptomatic arachnoid cyst were referred for surgery, with good outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Arachnoid cysts are found in a small percentage of brain scans performed for evaluation of headache in the setting of a hospital-based pediatric headache clinic. For the long run in these clinical settings, most of the cysts are asymptomatic. Precise anamnesis, neurologic examination, and imaging performed according to accepted practice guidelines may help clinicians determine if the headache and symptoms are caused by the cyst or if they should seek primary headache diagnosis with overlapping symptoms. The clinical distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (symptoms that are directly related to the arachnoid cyst) may be difficult. Family history of migraine may help in the diagnosis of asymptomatic patients.",

Emergency care providers are at an increased risk of CF secondary to their first responder roles and exposure to traumatic events. We aimed to investigate the current state of compassion fatigue among emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians, including an assessment of contributing factors.METHODS: We distributed a validated electronic questionnaire consisting of the Professional Quality of Life Scale with subscales for the three components of CF (compassion satisfaction, burnout and secondary traumatic stress), with each category scored independently. We collected data pertaining to day- versus night-shift distribution, hourly workload and child dependents. We included residents in EM, neurology, orthopedics, family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, and general surgery.RESULTS: We surveyed 255 residents, with a response rate of 75%. Of the 188 resident respondents, 18% worked a majority of their clinical shifts overnight, and 32% had child dependents. Burnout scores for residents who worked greater than 80 hours per week, or primarily worked overnight shifts, were higher than residents who worked less than 80 hours (mean score 25.0 vs 21.5; p=0.013), or did not work overnight (mean score 23.5 vs 21.3; p=0.022). EM residents had similar scores in all three components of CF when compared to other specialties. Secondary traumatic stress scores for residents who worked greater than 80 hours were higher than residents who worked less than 80 hours (mean score 22.2 vs 19.5; p=0.048), and those with child dependents had higher secondary traumatic stress than those without children (mean score 21.0 vs 19.1; p=0.012).CONCLUSION: CF scores in EM residents are similar to residents in other surgical and medical specialties. Residents working primarily night shifts and those working more than 80 hours per week appear to be at high risk of developing compassion fatigue. Residents with children are more likely to experience secondary traumatic stress.",

As it affects people in their high productivity age and leaves 50 % of them dead and almost 70 % of survivors disabled, many of them severely, the reasons of such a dismal outcome have been intensively researched all over the world. Nevertheless, despite more than a half a century of clinical and scientific effort and dramatic improvement of surgical repair of aneurysms, the causes of poor outcome remain enigmatic. Introduction of numerous in vitro and in vivo models to study the unleashed by SAH mechanisms that injured the brain significantly advanced our understanding of biology of cerebral vessels, brain responses to intracranial pressure changes, and the presence of blood clot in subarachnoid space. One of the most important animal models that significantly contributed to those advances has been a non-human primate model introduced at the Bryce Weir laboratory in the University of Alberta, Canada, in 1984. Since then, this model, with some modifications, has been successfully used in several animal laboratories in the USA, Canada, and Japan. We present the model characteristics and describe in details medical, surgical, imagining techniques that we have used at the Surgical Neurology Branch of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke from 1989.

Pain in ALS has been poorly studied and poorly managed. This study aimed to collate information regarding pain in ALS using standardized pain questionnaires. Forty-two patients with ALS participated in the study. Control subjects included 41 age-matched healthy volunteers and 42 age-matched patients with neurological conditions other than ALS. Data on pain were collected using the The Brief Pain Inventory and The painDetect Questionnaire. Eighty-five percent of subjects with ALS reported pain versus 50% of neurology clinic controls and 35% of healthy controls (p < 0.01). Pain in ALS included cramping, aching, tiring, sharp and tender, and was non-neuropathic. Pain impacted significantly on mood, general activity, relationships and general enjoyment of life. Fifty-four percent of people with painful ALS used regular analgesia and 29% regular opioids. Other non-motor symptoms suffered included tiredness, constipation, urinary problems, itching and drowsiness. In conclusion, these data support the fact that pain is a significant symptom in ALS which impacts on quality of life. These data can be used to educate clinicians and patients to promote better multidisciplinary management of ALS symptoms and a better quality of life.",

      "abstractText": "OBJECT: Most descriptions of spine surgery morbidity and mortality in the literature are retrospective. Emerging prospective analyses of adverse events (AEs) demonstrate significantly higher rates, suggesting underreporting in retrospective and prospective studies that do not include AEs as a targeted outcome. Emergency oncological spine surgeries are generally palliative to reduce pain and improve patients' neurology and health-related quality of life. In individuals with limited life expectancy, AEs can have catastrophic implications; therefore, an accurate AE incidence must be considered in the surgical decision-making process. The purpose of this study was to determine the true incidence of AEs associated with emergency oncological spine surgery.METHODS: The authors carried out a prospective cohort study in a quaternary care referral center that included consecutive patients admitted between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. Inclusion criteria were all patients undergoing emergency surgery for metastatic spine disease. AE data were reported and collected on standardized AE forms (Spine AdVerse Events Severity System, version 2 [SAVES V2] forms) at weekly dedicated morbidity and mortality rounds attended by attending surgeons, residents, fellows, and nursing staff.RESULTS: A total of 101 patients (50 males, 51 females) met the inclusion criteria and had complete data. Seventy-six patients (76.2%) had at least 1 AE, and 11 patients (10.9%) died during their admission. Intraoperative surgical AEs were observed in 32% of patients (9.9% incidental durotomy, 16.8% blood loss > 2 L). Transient neurological deterioration occurred in 6 patients (5.9%). Infectious complications in this patient population were significant (surgical site 6%, other 50.5%). Delirium complicated the postoperative period in 20.8% of cases.CONCLUSIONS: When evaluated in a rigorous prospective manner, metastatic spine surgery is associated with a higher morbidity rate than previously reported. This AE incidence must be considered by the patient, oncologist, and surgeon to determine appropriate management and preventative strategies to reduce AEs in this fragile patient population.",

To better characterize the genetic landscape of neurodevelopmental disorders, we analyzed patients in our pediatric neurogenetics clinic who underwent WES.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study on 78 patients with various neurodevelopmental disabilities and unrevealing workup prior to WES. We characterized their molecular diagnoses, clinical features, and whether their previous treatment plan changed due to WES results.RESULTS: The overall presumptive diagnostic rate for our cohort was 41% (n = 32 of 78 patients). Nineteen patients had a single autosomal dominant (AD) disorder, 11 had a single autosomal recessive (AR) disorder, 1 had an X-linked dominant disorder, and 1 had both an AD and an AR disorder. The 32 patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants exhibited various neurobehavioral and neuroimaging abnormalities, including intellectual disability/developmental delay (n = 28), cerebral palsy-like encephalopathy (n = 11), autism spectrum disorder (n = 5), delayed/hypomyelination (n = 7), and cerebellar abnormalities (n = 9). The results of WES affected management for all patients with a presumptive diagnosis, triggering reproductive planning (n = 27), disease monitoring initiation (n = 4), investigation of systemic involvement of the disorder(s) (n = 6), alteration of presumed disease inheritance pattern (n = 7), changing of prognosis (n = 10), medication discontinuation (n = 5) or initiation (n = 2), and clinical trial education (n = 3).INTERPRETATION: The high diagnostic yield of WES supports its use in pediatric neurology practices. It may also lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning. WES therefore serves as a critical tool for the child neurologist.",

In this context, this study was conducted to assess the correlation between imaging and neuropsychological testing for cases of early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.AIM OF THE STUDY: Analysis of the clinical and paraclinical aspects of Moroccan cases with Alzheimer's disease.METHODS: Seventeen sporadic cases and 8 family cases were seen at the memory clinic of the Neurology Department of the University of Casablanca Ibn Rochd Hospital. A family history was obtained through a clinical interview of the patient and a yes or no self-reporting questionnaire from the guardian or other family member. The disease was considered familial if at least one additional first degree relative suffered from early-onset AD-type dementia. All patients underwent standard somatic neurological examination, cognitive function assessment, brain imaging and laboratory tests. Written consent was obtained from the patients and their guardians prior to the study.RESULTS: In our study of 25 individuals, the observed mean age of AD patients was 64.52 ± 9.30 and we observed a slight female predominance (56% versus 44%). In addition, we found a prevalence of AD of approximately 20%, increasing with age, in the population below 60 years of age. Approximately half of our patients (48%) had a score lower than 10 and were affected by severe insanity, while 28% were affected by moderate severe insanity and 24% were light to moderately insane. Twenty-five patients underwent neuroimaging, 18 of whom were assessed by MRI, while 7 were assessed by CT. All patients had hippocampal atrophy, which progressed to affect others brain regions. The blood tests showed no abnormalities in the 25 enrolled AD cases.DISCUSSION: Age is undoubtedly the main risk factor for AD; this is also the true for our cases where advanced age was responsible for the exponential increase of the disease's frequency; it reached a peak in the age group of 60-69 years. The AD diagnosis approach is based on the presence of cerebral atrophy combined with the score of the mini-examination of the mental state (MMSE). In our study, in addition to the MMSE, depending on the level of education, the clinician used other tests that do not necessarily require a level of education such as the BEC96, visual short-term or digital memory assessment, work memory assessment, language assessment test (DO80) and apraxia. Neuropsychological examination of the cases with a score of less than 10 showed severe cognitive impairment. The cases presented memory and language impairments, aphasia, visual spatial disorientation, decreased autonomy, executive dysfunction and praxis deficits, all major causes of severe dementia. Neuroimaging revealed hippocampal and cortical atrophy. Correlated with the other studies that aimed to establish links between brain alterations and neuropsychological disorders, we can conclude that a higher level of atrophy reflects a decrease in neuropsychological performance.",

The majority of children showed a decline of serum MOG-IgG titres over time. Children with MOG antibodies did not differ in their age at presentation, sex ratio, the presence of oligoclonal bands, clinical symptoms or initial severity, apart from a higher CSF cell count (p=0.038), compared with children without MOG antibodies. In addition, further relapsing demyelinating episodes associated with MOG antibodies were observed only in children with MOG antibodies. All 19 children with MOG antibodies had a uniform MRI pattern, characterised by large, hazy and bilateral lesions and the absence of atypical MRI features (eg, mainly small lesions, well-defined lesions), which was significantly different compared to that of children without MOG antibodies (p=0.003; and p=0.032, respectively). In addition, children with MOG antibodies had involvement of more anatomical areas (p=0.035) including the myelon characterised by a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (p=0.003), more often a complete resolution of lesions (p=0.036) and a better outcome (p=0.038).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ADEM with MOG antibodies in our cohort had a uniform MRI characterised by large, bilateral and widespread lesions with an increased frequency of longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis and a favourable clinical outcome in contrast to children lacking MOG antibodies.",

Our objective was the evaluation of the specificity and sensitivity of the signs encountered with POLG mutations.DESIGN: Forty-four patients out of 154 with sequenced POLG gene had mutations affecting either one (POLG(+/-) group) or two POLG alleles (POLG(+/+) group). Phenotyping included clinical signs, electroneuromyography and brain imaging while mitochondrial investigations encompassed muscle histochemistry, respiratory chain assays and search for multiple mitochondrial deletions. The specificity and sensitivity of the signs associated with POLG mutations were analysed by comparison between POLG(+/+) and patients without POLG mutation.RESULTS: High sensitivity but low specificity was observed with single signs such as axonal sensory neuropathy, cerebellar syndrome, movement disorders and weakness involving ocular, pharyngeal, axial and/or limb muscles. Specificity was increased with combination of previous signs plus psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment and epilepsy. High specificity and sensitivity was only obtained with sensory neuronopathy associated with one of the following signs: weakness of ocular, pharyngeal, axial and/or limb muscles. Mitochondrial investigations did not suffice for diagnosis. The widespread neuromuscular signs were often present since disease onset and were the rule above 50 years of age leading to a very low probability of POLG mutations in patients with less than three signs and absent sensory neuropathy.CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypes associated with POLG mutations follow a reproducible pattern, which allows establishing a diagnostic flow chart.",

In earlier study we found patients who had HHV-6 reactive OCBs in their CSF. We wanted to investigate whether HHV-6 has an active role in diseases with demyelination.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the HHV-6-reactive cases in detail and investigate the possible independent role of HHV-6 in the development of central nervous system involvements with demyelination.STUDY DESIGN: We studied serum and CSF samples that were collected over a period of one year, from all patients who had oligoclonal bands (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and were examined in the Department of Neurology, University Central Hospital of Helsinki, Finland. Clinical evaluation was accomplished blinded of HHV-6 analysis and follow-up time was two years. All patients underwent MRI of the head and clinically indicated CSF analysis.RESULTS: The 17 patients with HHV-6-reactive OCBs were significantly younger and had significantly more IgG-OCBs in comparison to patients without HHV-6-reactive OCBs. Initial diagnoses in patients with HHV-6-reactive OCBs remained the same during the follow-up time.CONCLUSION: Patients with HHV-6-positive OCBs appear to form a separable group. In progressive neurological diseases HHV-6 may have a role in long-term infection with demyelination.",

The aim of our study was the clinical and radiological evaluation of the reliability of the CAS procedure over a two-year follow-up period.STUDY DESIGN: This study included 120 patients (mean age, 68 (48-86) years) admitted to our hospital between December 2010 and March 2013 for whom CAS was decided in the neurology, cardiovascular surgery and cardiology council. Symptomatic cases with more than 50% stenosis by angiography and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of more than 70% were included in the study. 80% of the asymptomatic patients were those detected during the screening before the coronary bypass surgery.RESULTS: The success rate of the procedure was found as 97.5%. No mortality or myocardial infarction was observed in any of the patients in whom CAS was applied successfully. In 1 symptomatic patient (0.8%), ischemic cerebrovascular event with sequelae was observed 24 hours after the procedure. In total, transient ischemic attack was observed in 2 patients (1.7%) 6 and 11 months after the procedure. Asymptomatic restenosis was detected in 3 patients (2.5% of the total, with 2 in the asymptomatic and 1 in the symptomatic group). Symptomatic restenosis was not observed. None of the patients experienced hyperperfusion syndrome.CONCLUSION: We believe the CAS procedure can be performed safely in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with low complication and high success rates.",

To our knowledge, life sciences industry (LSI)-sponsored registries have not been systematically categorized. This study represents a first step toward understanding such registries over time.METHODS: Studies described as registries were identified in the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Characteristics from these registry records were abstracted and analyzed.RESULTS: Of 1202 registries identified, approximately 47% reported LSI sponsorship. These 562 LSI registries varied in focus: medical devices (n = 193, 34%), specific drugs (n = 173, 31%), procedures (n = 29, 5%), or particular diseases (n = 139, 25%). Thirty-three registries (<6%) evaluated pregnancy outcomes. The most common therapeutic area was cardiovascular (n = 234, 42%); others included endocrinology, immunology, oncology, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurology. The two most often measured outcomes were clinical effectiveness and safety, each of which appeared in 363/562 (65%) of LSI registries. Other outcomes included real-world clinical practice patterns (n = 122, 22%), patient-reported outcomes (n = 106, 19%), disease epidemiology/natural history (n = 69, 12%), and economic outcomes (n = 30, 5%). The number of LSI registries and their geographic diversity has increased over time.CONCLUSIONS: The LSI registries represent a substantial proportion of all patient registries documented in ClinicalTrials.gov. These prospective studies are growing in number and encompass diverse therapeutic areas and geographic regions. Most registries measure multiple outcomes and capture real-world data that may be unavailable through other study designs. This classification of LSI registries documents their use for studying heterogeneity of diseases, examining treatment patterns, measuring patient-reported outcomes, examining economic outcomes, and performing comparative effectiveness research.",

Patients with depression have an earlier onset and rapid progression of cognitive decline. Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) is common in AD and MCI, and some degree of atrophy is found in almost all patients. In the present study, an attempt was made to know if MTA is more common in patients with AD/MCI with depression than those without it.METHODS: Patients reporting to the outpatient department of a neurology centre of a tertiary care hospital were recruited for the present study. After initial general physical and neurological examination, they were evaluated using National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Related Disorders Association criteria for diagnosis of AD. Clinical Dementia rating scale was used for the diagnosis of MCI. Cornell scale for depression in dementia (CSDD) was used.RESULTS: We found 20 cases with depression as per CSDD out of a sample of 37 patients (male:female = 30:7). There were 26 patients with AD and 11 with MCI. The mean age of all patients was 72.33 ± 6.45 years. The mean mini mental status examination score was 19.00 ± 6.73. The mean time since diagnosis was 4.19 ± 3.26 years. The mean Scheltens visual rating scale score for right MTA was 2.08 ± 0.95 and was 2.05 ± 0.94 for the left. Both scores did not differ statistically when analyzed using paired t-test (p > 0.05). However, difference in those with depression (2.36 ± 0.95) from those without depression (1.60 ± 0.74) was significant (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: MTA scores were higher in those with AD/MCI with depression than those without it.",

The survey queried the physicians' clinical setting; their use of headache classification systems, headache diaries, checklists, and diagnostic procedures; the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments prescribed; and headache chronicity and associated symptoms and disorders among their patients with TBI.RESULTS: Completed surveys were received from 193 respondents. The use of standardized classification systems and checklists was commonly reported. Respondents used nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment approaches with similar frequency and modest perceived success rates. A high frequency of headache-associated new sleep and mood disorders was reported. When response differences occurred between practice settings, they reflected a focus on headache diagnosis, classification, and pharmacologic treatment among neurology and specialty headache clinics, whereas a nonpharmacologic approach to management among TBI specialty and general rehabilitation clinicians was more commonly reported.CONCLUSION: Management strategies for treating headache after TBI vary widely among general and specialty clinical practices. This suggests that additional research is needed that would lead to an increase in the use of established headache classification and the development of standardized management approaches so that all practitioners who care for patients after TBI can provide consistent effective care.",

FEES is well known and widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of swallowing disorders. However, various protocols exist, and there is no consensus on the examination protocol. The objective of this prospective study was to determine the FEES protocol derived estimates of sensitivity (Se') to detection of aspiration in dysphagic patients. The study estimated the probability of aspiration as a function of the number of swallow trials in dysphagic patients using FEES. The derived sensitivity was calculated based on presence or absence of aspiration in a ten-swallow trial protocol as arbitrary 'gold standard'. Eighty-four persons were included, comprising two patient populations with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Dysphagia in one group was due to head and neck cancer and possible oncological treatment effects on swallowing; in the other it was a result of neurological disease. All patients underwent a standardized FEES examination using ten swallows of thin liquid followed by ten swallows of thick liquid, all in boluses of 10 cc each. FEES recordings were rated for aspiration by an expert panel blinded to patients' identity and clinical history. Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis techniques, and Log Rank/Mantel-Cox tests were used. In both patient populations the aspiration risk was underestimated when using a limited number (three or four) of swallow trials. The oncology and neurology patients differed significantly in the number of swallow trials required to determine aspiration for thin liquids (median values 2 and 7 respectively, P = 0.006). FEES protocols using a limited number of swallow trials can underestimate the aspiration risk in both oncological and neurological patients suffering from oropharyngeal dysphagia, especially when using boluses with a thin liquid consistency.

Inflammatory diseases including neuroinfections, CNS lymphoma and neurosarcoidosis must be excluded. Since CLIPPERS was described in 2010, many patients might have been misdiagnosed in the past. We therefore searched medical records from a large tertiary neurological center, the Department of Neurology at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, for patients discharged between 1999 and 2013 with a diagnosis of \"sarcoidosis with other localization\", \"other acute disseminating demyelination\", \"other demyelinating disease in the CNS\" or \"encephalitis, myelitis or encephalomyelitis\". Of 206 identified patients, 24 had been examined by brain biopsy and were included for further evaluation. Following clinical, neuroradiological and neuropathological review, 3 patients (12.5%) were reclassified as having CLIPPERS. Median long-term follow-up was 75 months. The present results suggest that clinical re-evaluation of patients previously diagnosed with unspecified inflammatory demyelinating CNS disease or atypical neurosarcoidosis may increase the detection rate of CLIPPERS. Further, potentially severe neurological deficits and progressive parenchymal atrophy on MRI may suggest neurodegenerative features, which emphasizes the need for early immunomodulatory treatment.",

A questionnaire for epilepsy based on the World Health Organization screening questionnaire was used. A final diagnosis of epilepsy was made by neurology specialists with the support of head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and electroencephalography (EEG) if available. The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment gap were analyzed in patients with active epilepsy within the past year and the past 5 years.RESULTS: Active epilepsy was identified in 91 patients within the past year and 117 patients within the past 5 years. The one-year prevalence was 2.8‰, and the five-year prevalence was 3.7‰. The prevalence for epilepsy active within the last year and the last five years was significantly higher in rural areas than in urban areas (P<0.05). Secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (53.8%) were the most common seizure type in patients whose epilepsy had been active in the last year. 34.1% of patients were diagnosed with structural or metabolic epilepsy. The most common cause for epilepsy was cerebrovascular disease (32.3%), followed by traumatic brain injury (29.0%). The treatment gap was 93.4%.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of epilepsy active within the last one and five years was higher in rural areas than in urban areas of Yueyang city. A large treatment gap exists in this area and a rational intervention strategy is needed.",

As observed, in immunocompromised individuals HSE presents peculiar clinical and paraclinical features, and poorer prognosis.METHODS: Here we describe a retrospective series of seven cases of HSE in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG), collected among three institutions in a 5-year period (during this time, a total of 1750 patients with HGG were treated).RESULTS: Diagnosis of the condition was particularly challenging due to the confounding clinical presentation and the atypical biological findings. As a result, antiviral treatment was started with a sharp delay compared with immunocompetent hosts. Prognosis was poor, with high short-term mortality and severe residual disability in survivors.CONCLUSIONS: The substantial incidence of HSE observed in our centres together with the difficulty in diagnosing the condition suggest that the incidence of this complication may be highly underestimated. The aim of our report is to strengthen the observation of HSE in patients with HGG and outline the key elements that may allow its diagnosis.",

Under the pressure of the breaching time and busy shifts some of the patients are discharged to the care of their general practitioners without adequate investigations. While most of the cases are due to benign causes, torticollis can be due to many congenital and acquired pathologies, some of which may need further investigation and urgent management. Atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS), tumours of the base of the skull and infections are among these causes. Delayed diagnosis may lead to worsening neurology and complicate the management. We report a case of a 5-year-old girl who presented to our fracture clinic with a fractured clavicle and torticollis; her subsequent investigations confirmed the diagnosis of AAS. Our patient responded to non-operative treatment and improved with no neurological complications. ",

We sought to determine the efficacy and safety of yoga breathing exercises, as well as the effects of those exercises on respiratory function, in such children.METHODS: This was a prospective open-label study of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD, recruited from among those followed at the neurology outpatient clinic of a university hospital in the city of S?o Paulo, Brazil. Participants were taught how to perform hatha yoga breathing exercises and were instructed to perform the exercises three times a day for 10 months.RESULTS: Of the 76 patients who entered the study, 35 dropped out and 15 were unable to perform the breathing exercises, 26 having therefore completed the study (mean age, 9.5 ± 2.3 years; body mass index, 18.2 ± 3.8 kg/m(2)). The yoga breathing exercises resulted in a significant increase in FVC (% of predicted: 82.3 ± 18.6% at baseline vs. 90.3 ± 22.5% at 10 months later; p = 0.02) and FEV1 (% of predicted: 83.8 ± 16.6% at baseline vs. 90.1 ± 17.4% at 10 months later; p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Yoga breathing exercises can improve pulmonary function in patients with DMD.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Primary intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH) is a rare neurological disorder, with bleeding confined to the ventricles only, without recognizable parenchymal or subarachnoid component.AIM: The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify clinical features, predisposing risk factors, etiology, radiological features and yield of diagnostic cerebral angiography in identifying the etiological causes.SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Records of patients admitted in neurology division were analyzed in a tertiary care teaching hospital.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the records of 27 patients with PIVH evaluated and treated at our institute from August 2010 to April 2013. PIVH was diagnosed as hemorrhage in the ventricles only, detected by computed tomography scan without evidence of intraparenchymal, subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage associated with trauma. CT angiography (CTA) alone was done in 10 patients (37.03%), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in 2 patients (7.4%) and both CTA as well as DSA was done in 15 patients (55.5%).STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Categorical and continuous data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.RESULTS: 17 (62.96%) patients were females and 10 (37.03%) were males with ratio of F:M= 1.7:1. Headache was the commonest mode of presentation (85.18%). Hypertension was most common predisposing factor (29.62%) followed by arterio-venous malformations (AVMs) (25.92%), moyamoya disease (MMD) (11.11%), lenticuostriate artery aneurysm (LSA) (11.11%), arterial dissections (7.4%) and dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) (3.7%).CONCLUSIONS: PIVH is rare and hypertension is important predisposing factor. Yield of cerebral angiography is high in diagnosing the etiology. AVMs and other rare etiological causes like MMD, LSA aneurysm, arterial dissection, and dAVF should be kept in mind with a high index of suspicion and warrants cerebral angiography in them, as some of the causes are potentially treatable.",

The aim of our study was to detect the development and type of autonomic disorders, find out the factors affecting their manifestation by analyzing the potential association with demographic variables related to clinical presentation, as well as the symptoms of the disease in a PD patient cohort.METHODS: The patients with PD treated at the Clinic of Neurology in Belgrade during a 2-year period, divided into 3 groups were studied: 25 de novo patients, 25 patients already treated and had no long-term levodopa therapy-related complications and 22 patients treated with levodopa who manifested levodopa-induced motor complications. Simultaneously, 35 healthy control subjects, matched by age and sex, were also analyzed.RESULTS: Autonomic nervous system malfunction was defined by Ewing diagnostic criteria. The tests, indicators of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, were significantly different in the PD patients as compared with the controls, suggesting the failure of both systems. However, it was shown, in the selected groups of patients, that the malfunction of both systems was present in two treated groups of PD patients, while de novo group manifested only sympathetic dysfunction. For this reason, the complete autonomic neuropathy was diagnosed only in the treated PD patients, while de novo patients were defined as those with the isolated sympathetic dysfunction. The patients with the complete autonomic neuropathy differed from the subjects without such neuropathy in higher cumulative and motor unified Parkinson's disease rating score (UPDRS) (p < 0.01), activities of daily living scores (p < 0.05), Schwab-England scale (p < 0.001) and Hoehn-Yahr scale. There was no difference between the patients in other clinical-demographic characteristics (sex, age at the time of diagnosis, actual age, duration of disease, involved side of the body, pain and freezing), but mini mental status (MMS) score and Hamilton depression and anxiety rating scale were significantly lower (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Our results confirm a high prevalence of autonomic nervous system disturbances among PD patients from the near onset of disease, with a predominant sympathetic nervous system involvement. The patients who developed complete autonomic neuropathy (both sympathetic and parasympathetic) were individuals with considerable level of functional failure, more severe clinical presentation and the existing anxiety and depression.",

Using immunohistochemical techniques abnormal protein aggregates have been identified in IBM, including some associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Our objective was to investigate the diagnostic utility of a number of markers of protein aggregates together with mitochondrial and inflammatory changes in IBM.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. The sensitivity of pathological features was evaluated in cases of Griggs definite IBM. The diagnostic potential of the most reliable features was then assessed in clinically typical IBM with rimmed vacuoles (n=15), clinically typical IBM without rimmed vacuoles (n=9) and IBM mimics-protein accumulation myopathies containing rimmed vacuoles (n=7) and steroid-responsive inflammatory myopathies (n=11).SETTING: Specialist muscle services at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London.RESULTS: Individual pathological features, in isolation, lacked sensitivity and specificity. However, the morphology and distribution of p62 aggregates in IBM were characteristic and in a myopathy with rimmed vacuoles, the combination of characteristic p62 aggregates and increased sarcolemmal and internal major histocompatibility complex class I expression or endomysial T cells were diagnostic for IBM with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100%. In an inflammatory myopathy lacking rimmed vacuoles, the presence of mitochondrial changes was 100% sensitive and 73% specific for IBM; characteristic p62 aggregates were specific (91%), but lacked sensitivity (44%).CONCLUSIONS: We propose an easily applied diagnostic algorithm for the pathological diagnosis of IBM. Additionally our findings support the hypothesis that many of the pathological features considered typical of IBM develop later in the disease, explaining their poor sensitivity at disease presentation and emphasising the need for revised pathological criteria to supplement the clinical criteria in the diagnosis of IBM.",

Data were acquired though detailed interviews, while a history of falling referred to the period of 6 months before testing. After a interview related to the circumstances of the last fall sustained by PD patients, the participants were evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Hoehn and Yahr scale, the Falls Efficacy Scale and the Self-Assessment Disability Scale, New Freezing of Gait questionnaire for frequency and impact of freezing, and the Hamilton Depression and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale.RESULTS: A total of 60% of individuals reported a fall in the 6-month period before testing. Multivariate regression showed that patients with PD who had a Self-Assessment Disability Scale score of ?56 and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale total score of ?69 were 2.04 and 3.32 times more likely to fall, respectively (95% CI 1.10-3.79, P = 0.023 for Self-Assessment Disability Scale and 95% CI 1.83-6.00, P = 0.001 for Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). In contrast, a decrease of risk for falling by 57% was observed among those who practiced regular physical activity before the onset of PD (95% CI 0.23-0.80, P = 0.008).CONCLUSION: There is a strong relationship between falling and self-perceived disability, whereas previous physical exercise had a protective effect.",

FRAX and Qfracture are risk calculators that estimate the 10-year risk of hip and major fractures and guide definitive investigation for osteoporosis using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) imaging. It is unclear which PD patients should be considered for fracture risk assessment and whether FRAX or Qfracture should be used. Seventy-seven patients with PD were recruited in the movement disorders clinic. Data were collected on PD-related characteristics and fracture risk scores were calculated. Patients with previous osteoporotic fractures had a higher incidence of falls (p = 0.0026) and use of bilateral walking aids (p = 0.0187) in addition to longer disease duration (p = 0.0037). Selecting patients with falls in combination with either disease duration >5 years, bilateral walking aids, or previous osteoporotic fracture distinguished patients with and without previous osteoporotic fracture with specificity 67.7 % (95 % CI 55.0-78.8) and sensitivity 100.0 % (95 % CI 73.5-100.0). Qfracture calculated significantly higher fracture risk scores than FRAX for hip (p < 0.0001) and major (p = 0.0008) fracture in PD patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that FRAX outperformed Qfracture with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95 % CI 0.70-0.97, p = 0.0004) for FRAX and 0.68 (95 % CI 52-86, p = 0.0476) for Qfracture major fracture risk calculators. We suggest that falls in combination with either a disease duration longer than 5 years or bilateral walking aids or previous osteoporotic fracture should be used as red flags in PD patients to prompt clinicians to perform a FRAX fracture risk assessment in the neurology clinic.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: The GGGGCC-repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most frequent mutation found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Most of the studies on C9orf72 have relied on repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) methods for detection of the expansions. To investigate the inherent limitations of this technique, we compared methods and results of 14 laboratories.METHODS: The 14 laboratories genotyped DNA from 78 individuals (diagnosed with ALS or FTD) in a blinded fashion. Eleven laboratories used a combination of amplicon-length analysis and RP-PCR, whereas three laboratories used RP-PCR alone; Southern blotting techniques were used as a reference.RESULTS: Using PCR-based techniques, 5 of the 14 laboratories got results in full accordance with the Southern blotting results. Only 50 of the 78 DNA samples got the same genotype result in all 14 laboratories. There was a high degree of false positive and false negative results, and at least one sample could not be genotyped at all in 9 of the 14 laboratories. The mean sensitivity of a combination of amplicon-length analysis and RP-PCR was 95.0% (73.9-100%), and the mean specificity was 98.0% (87.5-100%). Overall, a sensitivity and specificity of more than 95% was observed in only seven laboratories.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the wide range seen in genotyping results, we recommend using a combination of amplicon-length analysis and RP-PCR as a minimum in a research setting. We propose that Southern blotting techniques should be the gold standard, and be made obligatory in a clinical diagnostic setting.",

There were many cutaneous venous prominences over her body. CT and MR brain scans showed multiple venous anomalies and venous occlusive disease of the left sylvian fissure and superior sagittal sinus. We excluded arteriovenous malformation and dural fistulae with cerebral angiography. Following a clinical genetics assessment, we diagnosed blue rubber bleb naevus syndrome (BRBNS) and gave amitriptyline for her pain. There are only 200 cases of BRBNS in the literature, and central nervous system involvement is rarer still. The syndrome involves multiple cutaneous and visceral venous malformations. Most appear to be sporadic though a few have autosomal dominant inheritance. Although rare, BRBNS represents an important differential diagnosis for patients presenting with multiple and/or multisystem vascular malformations.",

This study included 5 girls (41.7%) and 7 boys (58.3%) with a mean age of symptom onset of 5.2 ± 6.29 years (range: 0-18 years), who were followed at our institution for a mean of 1.8 ± 1.73 years (range: 0-6.5 years). Among the patients, 3 had no risk factors, 2 had 1 risk factor, and 7 had multiple risk factors. Anticoagulant therapy was administered to 4 patients, of which 1 had neurological sequelae; neurological sequelae or exitus occurred in 4 of the 8 patients who did not receive anticoagulant therapy. The present findings showed that appropriate prophylaxis in appropriately selected patients reduced the rate of recurrence of CSVT. ",

Study personnel who were blinded to results of nerve conduction studies collected data on vibratory perception with both tuning forks at bilateral (1) great toe and (2) distal interphalangeal joint on the second digit. Published normative data were used to determine abnormal scores for the Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork and the qualitative tuning fork; axonal neuropathy was determined based on sensory nerve action potential amplitudes as per our electromyography laboratory standards.RESULTS: A total of 186 sensory nerves from 100 patients were tested with tuning forks and nerve conduction studies. The sensitivity and specificity of the Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork to detect axonal neuropathy was 26% and 89%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the conventional 128-Hz tuning fork to detect axonal neuropathy was 20% and 88%, respectively. The extended McNemar test showed no significant difference in sensitivity or specificity between the 2 tuning forks (÷ = 1.695; P = 0.43).CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in diagnostic accuracy between the Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork and conventional tuning fork for detecting sensory axonal neuropathies; however, the Rydel-Seiffer is easier to use and may be superior for longitudinal assessments.",

A young woman was admitted with fever and NORSE in the neurology intensive care unit. In addition to supportive measures, she was treated with intravenous lorazepam, phenytoin sodium, sodium valproate, midazolam and thiopentone sodium. While on thiopentone sodium, she developed involuntary twitches involving her upper limbs and face with EEG showing no evidence of ongoing status epilepticus. Because of the temporal relationship with thiopentone infusion, we tapered the dose of thiopentone sodium, which resulted in the disappearance of the movements.

The diagnosis is rather difficult because the initial symptoms mimic post-dural puncture headache.CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old primipara was admitted to the hospital at 38 weeks gestation for a cesarean section due to premature rupture of membranes and meconium stained amniotic fluid. During the procedure a single puncture between L2 and L3 vertebrae was made with the use of a 26-gauge, pencil-point needle. The amount of 2.8 ml of analgesic solution was administered in order to obtain subarachnoid analgesia at the level of Th4 and Th5 vertebrae. Postpartum recovery was uneventful for the first two days. On the third day the patient developed strong headache in the forehead area and tinnitus. An anesthesiologist diagnosed post-dural puncture headache (PDPH). The patient received 1 g of Paracetamol every 6 hours intravenously together with 3000 ml of crystalloid solution for 24 hours. As a result, the patient recovered and was discharged home with her infant. Five days later the patient presented at the neurology clinic because of strong and chronic temporal lobe headache. No other complaints were reported. Upon admission, the patient had a head CT followed by an MRI examination, which revealed cranial hematomas localized bilaterally in the area of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, spreading from the cranial vault to the skull base. The width of the hematomas was: 3-4 mm on the left and 5-6 mm on the right side. Hematomas infiltrated the anterior part of the medial longitudinal fissure. Magnetic resonance angiography showed normal images of the arteries, veins, and the dural venous sinuses. No vascular malformations, which may be a source of intracranial hemorrhage, were found. Other tests showed normal results. Patient condition during hospitalization was stable. Conservative treatment was implemented, i.e. fluids administered intravenously anti-edematous drugs, analgesic medications and bed rest. All pain complaints subsided and a control CT scan showed that hematomas evolved as expected i.e. their HU density decreased. About 6 weeks later the patient had a CT head scan, performed in outpatient settings, which showed complete absorption of extravasated blood.CONCLUSION: The presented case shows headaches in obstetric patients require thorough diagnostic examinations and appropriate management. In addition to the most typical PDPH, it may be the first sign of life-threatening intracranial pathology",

The aim of the present study is to characterize clinical presentation, predisposing factors, neuroimaging findings, and outcomes of the disease in the Tunisian population.METHODS: This is a prospective study including patients referred to the Neurology Department of the Military Hospital of Tunis between January 2009 and December 2012. The diagnosis of CVT was confirmed in all patients using magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography. The demographic, clinical, radiological, and outcome data were recorded and analyzed. Median follow-up was 16 months (range 6 months to 4 years). Primary outcome was death or dependency as assessed by modified Rankin score more than 2 at the end of follow-up.RESULTS: This study included 41 patients with CVT. Mean age was 41.24 years, predominantly women (68%). The mode of onset was acute in 10 patients (24%), subacute in 26 (64%), and chronic in 5 (12%). The most common presenting features were headache, observed in 83% of the patients, followed by seizures, focal motor deficits, papilledema, and mental status changes. Lateral (56%) and superior longitudinal (51%) sinuses were the most commonly involved. Multiple sinuses were involved in 46% of cases. Nineteen patients (46%) had a D-dimer level more than 500 ng/mL. Major causes of CVT were thrombophilia (56%), either genetic or acquired, obstetric and gynecological (50%), and septic (34%). Outcome was favorable in 83% of patients. At the end of follow-up, 32 patients (78%) had complete recovery (modified Rankin Scale [mRs] score 0-1), 2 (5%) had partial recovery (mRs score 2), and 4 (10%) were dependent (mRs score 3-5). One patient (2.5%) had a recurrent sinus thrombosis.CONCLUSIONS: Our Tunisian population presented distinct risk factors profile with high frequency of thrombophilia, infections, and postpartum state. Oral contraceptive use is not a major risk factor in our population. The overall prognosis was good.",

The therapy for chronic migraine with botulinum toxin is now established in adults. However, there is only limited experience in the use of botulinum toxin in paediatric patients.METHODS: 10 patients aged 13 - 17 years who suffered from chronic migraine according to the IHS criteria were injected at 31 specific injection points of the head and neck muscles with a total amount of 150 IE of botulinum toxin A (Botox®) according to the approved scheme. The number of headache days per month over the following 9 months was recorded and side effects were retrospectively determined.RESULTS: The responder rate (that is reduction of headache days per month more than 50 %) was 7/10 at three months after the injection. On average the number of headache days per month was reduced from 19.2 days to a minimum of 10.1 days. After three to six months the number of headache days increased again in all responders. Slight local side effects such as redness or temporary pain were observed in all patients, but severe side effects such as infections, fever, ptosis or allergic reactions did not occur.DISCUSSION: This small case series shows that the therapy for chronic migraine with botulinum toxin A can also be effective and safe in adolescents. As many adolescents still suffer from headaches later as adults a link between neuropaediatricians and neurologists is justifiable. An early botulinum toxin therapy followed by the transition of the adolescents would be helpful.",

Moreover, most previous studies have either not used strict inclusion criteria or standardized psychometric tests for developmental outcome.METHODS: Ninety-five children, aged one-to-five years under follow up for more than six months in Pediatric Neurology Clinic of a tertiary care hospital with the diagnosis of infantile spasm were enrolled in this cross-sectional study if they had completed one or more years after the onset of spasms. The study period was January-December 2011. Neurodevelopment of each child was assessed using Development Profile 3 and Gross Motor Function Classification System. History regarding epilepsy frequency and control in the last one year was taken.RESULTS: Perinatal asphyxia was the commonest etiology in 43/95 children (45.2%). Favorable neurodevelopmental outcome was observed in 8/95 patients. Favorable epilepsy outcome in 58/95 (61.1%) patients was associated with treatment lag?3 months between apparent onset of spasms and institution of therapy {OR 2 (1.1-3.8)} and response to first line antiepileptic drug {5 (2.6-10)}.CONCLUSIONS: The commonest etiology was potentially preventable perinatal cause. Early appropriate treatment may have a favorable epilepsy outcome.",

We developed a smartphone application that aids stroke patient self-screening and hospital selection, and may also decrease hospital arrival time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The application was developed for iPhone and Android smartphones. Map data for the application were adopted from the open map. For hospital registration, a web page (http://stroke119.org) was developed using PHP and MySQL.RESULTS: The Stroke 119 application includes a stroke screening tool and real-time information on nearby hospitals that provide thrombolytic treatment. It also provides information on stroke symptoms, thrombolytic treatment, and prescribed actions when stroke is suspected. The stroke screening tool was adopted from the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale and is displayed in a cartoon format. If the user taps a cartoon image that represents abnormal findings, a pop-up window shows that the user may be having a stroke, informs the user what to do, and directs the user to call emergency services. Information on nearby hospitals is provided in map and list views, incorporating proximity to the user's location using a Global Positioning System (a built-in function of smartphones). Users can search for a hospital according to specialty and treatment levels. We also developed a web page for hospitals to register in the system. Neurology training hospitals and hospitals that provide acute stroke care in Korea were invited to register. Seventy-seven hospitals had completed registration.CONCLUSION: This application may be useful for reducing hospital arrival times for thrombolytic candidates.",

While this drug is known to be effective for the treatment of CPS, more than 30% of patients remain drug resistant to CBZ mono-therapy. We examined a possible relationship between patients' response to CBZ mono-therapy and the G2677T SNP of the ABCB1 gene. Three hundred and fourteen patients with CPS were recruited from the Neurology Department of the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, of whom 152 were responders and the other 162 were non-responders to CBZ mono-therapy. DNA was extracted from blood samples and real-time PCR was performed to detect the G2677T SNP of the ABCB1 gene. Results were described as genotype frequencies and compared by logistic regression analysis. Among the 152 responders, 74% had the GG genotype. However, among the 162 non-responders, 26.5% had the GT genotype and 39% had the TT genotype. There was a significant difference in genotype frequency (TT vs GG; odds ratio 4.70; 95% confidence interval, 2.70-8.20) between responders and non-responders. The presence of the T allele of the G2677T SNP appears to be a useful screening marker to determine if a patient is going to be resistant to CBZ as a single drug therapy in the treatment of CPS. ",

Apathy has been associated with depression, cognitive deficits, and poor quality of life. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of apathy in Mexican subjects with PD and its correlation with clinical and demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytic study was carried out. Consecutive subjects with PD attending the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City were included. Demographic and other relevant clinical data were collected. The Apathy Scale was applied to all subjects. A cut-off score of ? 14 was used. A total of 241 non-demented patients (52.7 % male) were included. Apathy was found in 43 % of subjects. Lower body mass index, older age of PD onset, cognitive decline and disease severity were all related to apathy. The use of dopamine agonists or rasagiline was more common in patients with low apathy scores. Our results show that the prevalence of apathy in Mexican subjects with PD is similar to other reports.",

Vital signs were stable, ECG showed sinus rhythm, laboratory parameters were normal, without signs of liver or kidney damage and without coagulopathy.DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Diagnosis was local tissue reaction due to a snake bite of a sidewinder rattlesnake without evidence of systemic toxic effect. Due to the absence of systemic toxic effects the patient received monitoring of his vital signs and we controlled local tissue reaction constantly and laboratory parameters every 6 hours, as recommended by the \"Giftnotrufzentrale\" (poison emergency advisory service). The patient left hospital on his own will against medical advice in the night after first laboratory control, which showed no signs of organ damage and we recommended reasessment the following morning. At that time the swelling had extended to the whole arm, furthermore large hematoma reaching up to the axilla had developed over night. Again we contacted the \"Giftnotrufzentrale\" and decided to begin the administration of an antivenom, after allergic testing. The administration was without complications, the swelling decreased constantly and since laboratory controll still showed no signs of systemic toxin effect, we could discharge the patient on day 3. Follow-up visit 6 months later showed complete and natural healing.CONCLUSION: Snake bites are altogether rare among our patients, nevertheless since possible toxin effects and its dynamics are unpredictable and can vary highly, they demand monitoring at close intervals of vitals signs, local swelling and laboratory parameters. As early as possible an advisory service, such as \"Giftnotrufzentrale\" should be contacted to acquire information on possible toxin effects and availability of antivenoms. Contact to other medical disciplines (e.g. dermatology, intensive care unit, surgery, neurology, dialysis…) should be sought, depending on the further course of toxin effects. Possible comorbidities as well as allergisation due to previous bites strongly influence the course of the disease and should be evaluated. We recommend to keep precise records on the ocurrence of systemic toxin effects, as well as on local findings (e.g. fotodocumentation, marking of erythema, measurement of swelling). Manipulation of the wound is usually ineffective and therefore not recommended, also in respect of self-endangerment. After stabilization of the patient a vaccination against tetanus, if necessary, should not be forgotten.",

We therefore decided to screen patients with apparently non-syndromic BSN for ADAR1 mutations, and for an upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).METHODS: We performed Sanger sequencing of ADAR1 in a series of patients with BSN presenting to us during our routine clinical practice. We then undertook detailed clinical and neuroradiological phenotyping in nine mutation-positive children. We also measured the expression of ISGs in peripheral blood from these patients, and in children with BSN who did not have ADAR1 mutations.RESULTS: Nine ADAR1 mutation-positive patients from seven families demonstrated an acute (five cases) or subacute (four cases) onset of refractory, four-limb dystonia starting between 8 months and 5 years of age. Eight patients were developmentally normal at initial presentation. In seven cases, the disease was inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, while two related patients were found to have a heterozygous (dominant) ADAR1 mutation. All seven mutation-positive patients assayed showed an upregulation of ISGs (median: 12.50, IQR: 6.43-36.36) compared to controls (median: 0.93, IQR: 0.57-1.30), a so-called interferon signature, present many years after disease onset. No interferon signature was present in four children with BSN negative for mutations in ADAR1 (median: 0.63, IQR: 0.47-1.10).CONCLUSIONS: ADAR1-related disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of apparently non-syndromic BSN with severe dystonia of varying evolution. The finding of an interferon signature provides a useful screening test for the presence of ADAR1 mutations in this context, and may suggest novel treatment approaches.",

The aim of this hospital-based study was to get an insight into the effectiveness and tolerability of low cost antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in Bangladeshi people with epilepsy.METHODS: This retrospective chart review was done from hospital records in weekly Epilepsy outdoor clinic of Department of Neurology, Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) from October 1998 to February 2013. A total of 854 epilepsy patients met the eligibility criteria (had a complete record of two years of follow up data) from hospital database. A checklist was used to take demographics (age and gender), epilepsy treatment and adverse event related data. At least two years of follow up data were considered for analysis.RESULTS: Out of 854 patients selected, majority of the patients attending outdoor clinic were >11-30 years age group (55.2%) with a mean age of 20.3 ± 9 years and with a male (53%) predominance. Focal epilepsy were more common (53%), among whom secondary generalized epilepsy was the most frequent diagnosis (67%) followed by complex partial seizure (21%). Among those with Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (46%), generalized tonic clonic seizure was encountered in 74% and absence seizure was observed in 13%. The number of patients on monotherapy and dual AED therapy were 67% and 24% respectively and polytherapy (i.e. >3 AEDs) was used only in 9%. CBZ (67%) was the most frequently prescribed AED, followed by VPA (43%), PHB (17%), and PHT (8%). CBZ was prescribed in 37% patients as monotherapy followed by VPA in 21% and PHB in 8% patients. Newer generation drugs eg lemotrigine and topiramate were used only as add on therapy in combination with CBZ and VPA in only 2% patients. The treatment retention rates over the follow up period for the AEDs in monotherapy varied between 86 and 91% and were highest for CBZ, followed by VPA. Most of the combination regimens had a treatment retention rate of 100%. The effectiveness of AED in terms of reduction of seizure frequency was highest for PHT (100%) and PHB (98%) followed by CBZ (96%) and VPA (95%). PHB and PHT were the cheapest of all AEDs (42 I$ and 56 I$/ year respectively). The costs of VPA and CBZ were two times and LTG and TOP were six to eight times higher. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) were observed among 140 (24.5%) of those with monotherapy. PHT (64%) was the most common drug to cause ADR, CBZ was at the bottom of the list to cause adverse effect (11.6%). VPA and PHB caused weight gain commonly. Adjustment of drug dose or withdrawal due to ADRs was necessary in 39% with PHT and 26% with PHB.CONCLUSION: Though PHT and PHB are cheapest and efficacious among all, CBZ and VPA are less costly, effective and well tolerated drug for seizure control in context of Bangladesh.",

Along with increasing handicaps in daily life, patients with PD also face problems with psychosocial adjustment. This study explored the experiences of older Taiwanese individuals at different stages of PD. Qualitative design with in-depth interviews was conducted with participants being treated at the neurology outpatient department in a teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. The study included nine men and six women, aged 65-80 years, with PD at stages 1-4. Comparative analysis of the interviews revealed four themes: ignorance of symptoms, loss of control, gradual deterioration, and a deep sense of helplessness. In stage 1, symptoms were not significant at the onset of PD. For most participants, others first detected the symptoms, rather than themselves. During stage 2, although they could still care for themselves, they became very anxious when the effects of medication disappeared and their reactions slowed before they took the next dose. During stage 3, the physical capacity of the body decreased gradually and affected the patient's participation in social activities. In stage 4, older patients gradually became dependent on others in their daily lives. They were upset and worried that the symptoms would worsen and make them become a burden for their children. By understanding the perceptions of elderly patients at different stages of PD, this study has organized the key care requirements into four stages. These include the following: (1) provide more information on the disease in stage 1, (2) increase guidance on regular medication usage and establish a support system in stage 2, (3) highlight the importance of a safe living environment and encourage participation in support groups in stage 3, and (4) assist patients to find the meaning of life and value of existence in stage 4.",

Twenty-nine patients (23 women) were identified of a total of 790 patients, a frequency of 3.7%. Female gender and presurgical psychiatric diagnosis, other than psychosis, were significant risk factors for PNEA development. In female patients with a preoperative psychiatric diagnosis the chance of developing PNEA after epilepsy surgery was 8.5%. PNEA developed between 2 weeks and 10 years after epilepsy surgery, independently of outcome of epileptic seizures. In most cases, PNEA differed from the present or past epileptic seizures, and motor symptoms were the most common manifestations. Seizures after epilepsy surgery should be carefully evaluated. Physicians should consider the possibility of PNEA, especially in female patients with preoperative psychiatric comorbidity developing \"atypical\" seizures with motor manifestations postoperatively, even many years after epilepsy surgery.

The aim of this study was to compare ischemic stroke and nonischemic vertigo patient groups and to investigate independent factors associated with ischemic stroke. We examined 332 consecutive patients with an acute feeling of imbalance who showed no neurologic findings or responsible lesions on CT scan at the hyperacute phase. We examined their clinical backgrounds, physical findings, and laboratory examinations, with ischemic stroke diagnosed by later CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We identified 41 (12.3%) ischemic stroke patients. Atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 4.1; 95% confidence interval 1.4-11.5), white blood cell count (10(3)/ìL, 1.4; 1.2-1.6), head and/or neck pain (4.6; 2.1-10.3), first attack of imbalance feeling (3.3; 1.1-12.2), and dizziness (3.7; 1.7-8.3) were significant and independent factors associated with ischemic stroke among patients with an acute feeling of imbalance. We used these factors to calculate an \"imbalance score\"; 1 point was given for the presence of each factor and a score of 3-5 points was independently associated with ischemic stroke. An awareness of these factors may indicate that further examinations including MRI are necessary to rule out ischemic stroke. ",

Patients 30 years or older were eligible for the study if they did not have a history of stroke or cardiovascular disease.RESULTS: During the study period, 111 patients (58 in the carpal tunnel syndrome group and 53 in the control group) were enrolled, with a mean age of 56 years (range, 32-79 years). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics except maximum carotid intima-media thickness and body mass index. The maximum intima-media thickness was greater in the carpal tunnel syndrome group (mean ± SD, 1.05 ± 0.17 mm) than the control group (0.85 ± 0.22 mm; P < .0001). The body mass index was greater among the controls (P = .012). Simple linear regression analysis revealed that age (P < .0001), carpal tunnel syndrome (P < .0001), hypertension (P = .022), and systolic blood pressure (P = .034) were statistically significantly associated with increased intima-media thickness. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that hypertension (P = .033), systolic blood pressure (P = .022), age (P < .0001), and carpal tunnel syndrome (P < .0001) were significantly associated with increased intima-media thickness, with carpal tunnel syndrome being the most influential factor (â = 0.489).CONCLUSIONS: The maximum carotid intima-media thickness was significantly increased in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome compared to controls. Chronic inflammation beyond the traditional cardiovascular risk factors might be related to increased carotid intima-media thickness in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.",

In 66% of the cases, doctors had asked about any adverse drug effects during every visit. Almost all patients with intractable epilepsy had been informed about surgical options or referred to a surgical centre of reference for an evaluation at some point, although referrals usually took place more than 3 years after the initial proposal. Safety issues had been explained to 37% of the patients and less than half of women of childbearing age with epilepsy had received counselling regarding contraception and pregnancy at least once a year.CONCLUSIONS: The care we provide is appropriate according to many of the quality measures, but we must deliver more counselling and information necessary for the care of epileptic patients in different stages of life.",

The diagnostic process is often long and complex with most patients undergoing multiple invasive and costly investigations without ever reaching a conclusive molecular diagnosis. The advent of massively parallel, next-generation sequencing promises to revolutionize genetic testing and shorten the 'diagnostic odyssey' for many of these patients. We performed a pilot study using heterogeneous ataxias as a model neurogenetic disorder to assess the introduction of next-generation sequencing into clinical practice. We captured 58 known human ataxia genes followed by Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing in 50 highly heterogeneous patients with ataxia who had been extensively investigated and were refractory to diagnosis. All cases had been tested for spinocerebellar ataxia 1-3, 6, 7 and Friedrich's ataxia and had multiple other biochemical, genetic and invasive tests. In those cases where we identified the genetic mutation, we determined the time to diagnosis. Pathogenicity was assessed using a bioinformatics pipeline and novel variants were validated using functional experiments. The overall detection rate in our heterogeneous cohort was 18% and varied from 8.3% in those with an adult onset progressive disorder to 40% in those with a childhood or adolescent onset progressive disorder. The highest detection rate was in those with an adolescent onset and a family history (75%). The majority of cases with detectable mutations had a childhood onset but most are now adults, reflecting the long delay in diagnosis. The delays were primarily related to lack of easily available clinical testing, but other factors included the presence of atypical phenotypes and the use of indirect testing. In the cases where we made an eventual diagnosis, the delay was 3-35 years (mean 18.1 years). Alignment and coverage metrics indicated that the capture and sequencing was highly efficient and the consumable cost was ?£400 (€460 or US$620). Our pathogenicity interpretation pathway predicted 13 different mutations in eight different genes: PRKCG, TTBK2, SETX, SPTBN2, SACS, MRE11, KCNC3 and DARS2 of which nine were novel including one causing a newly described recessive ataxia syndrome. Genetic testing using targeted capture followed by next-generation sequencing was efficient, cost-effective, and enabled a molecular diagnosis in many refractory cases. A specific challenge of next-generation sequencing data is pathogenicity interpretation, but functional analysis confirmed the pathogenicity of novel variants showing that the pipeline was robust. Our results have broad implications for clinical neurology practice and the approach to diagnostic testing. ",

Patients of the acupuncture group received acupuncture stimulation of Baihui (GV 20), Neiguan (P 6), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Taichong (LR 3), etc. and scalp-point Motor Area, Sensory Area, Balance Area, once daily, 5 times a week for 20 times. Patients of the catgut embedding group received catgut embedding at the acupoints same to acupuncture group, once every 10 days, 3 times altogether. Additionally, both groups received regular treatment of neurology (controlling blood pressure, blood sugar and blood lipids levels, physical therapy, etc.) and early rehabilitation training (limb otor training). The patients' functional mobility was evaluated by simplified Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (FMA) and Modified Bathel Index Scale (MBI). The level of serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was detected using latex agglutination reaction method; and serum in terleukin-6 (IL-6) content measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: lts After 30 days' treatment, the mean scores of FMA and MBI were significantly increased in both acupuncture group and catgut embedding grou p (P < 0.05), suggesting an improvement of the cerebral infarction patient's functional mobility after the treatment. The therapeutic effect of the catgut embedding was obviously superior to that of the acupuncture grou p (P < 0. 05). The mean contents of serum IL-6 and hs-CRP of the two groups were significantly decreased after the treatmen t (P < 0.05), suggesting a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine and inflammatory mediator levels, respectively. The levels of both serum IL-6 and hs-CRP of the catgut embedding group were markedly lower than those of the acupuncture group ( P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: ion Acupoint catgut embedding therapy is effective in improving cerebral infarction patients' functional mobility, which is related to its action in inhibiting inflammatory reaction in the early stage of cerebral ischemic injury.",

In particular, medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is associated with disorders in emotion recognition from facial expressions. About one-third of patients with MTLE experienced febrile seizures (FSs) during childhood. In the present study, we investigated facial emotion recognition ability in a group of 38 school-aged children with antecedent FSs and in an age- and sex-matched control group. Children with abnormal general visuoperceptual abilities were excluded. Children with FSs showed lower recognition scores versus controls in both matching (28.64 vs 33.47; p<.0001) and labeling (21.25 vs 23.03; p=.001) facial emotions. Our findings support the hypothesis that FSs can be associated during childhood with a dysfunction within the neural network subserving the processing of facial expressions of the basic emotions. ",

Furthermore, both disorders present high psychiatric comorbidity, and video-EEG is the gold standard to make differential diagnoses. In this study, we described and compared the clinical presentation and the frequency of psychiatric disorders codified in DSM IV in two groups of patients, one with PNESs and the other with DRE, admitted in a tertiary care epilepsy center of Buenos Aires, Argentina. We included 35 patients with PNESs and 49 with DRE; all were admitted in the video-EEG unit in order to confirm an epilepsy diagnosis and determine surgical treatment possibilities. All patients underwent a neurological and psychiatric assessment, according to standardized protocol (SCID I and II; DSM IV criteria). Student's t test was performed to compare continuous variables and Chi square test to compare qualitative variables. In this study, 33 (67%) patients with DRE and 35 (100%) patients with PNESs met criteria for at least one disorder codified in Axis I of DSM IV (p=0.003). Differences in the frequency of psychiatric disorder presentation were found between groups. Anxiety disorders (16.32% vs 40%; p=0.015), trauma history (24.5% vs 48.57%; p=0.02), posttraumatic stress disorder (4.08% vs 22.85%; p=0.009), and personality cluster B disorders (18.37% vs 42.86%; p=0.02) were more frequent in the group with PNESs. Psychotic disorders were more frequent in the group with DRE (20.4% vs 2.85%; p=0.019). Depression was equally prevalent in both groups. Standardized psychiatric assessment provides information that could be used by the mental health professional who receives the referral in order to improve quality of care and smooth transitions to proper PNES treatment, which should include a multidisciplinary approach including neurology and psychiatry.

Survey respondents (N=505) were predominantly board-certified American Academy of Neurology members. Approximately 20% of respondent neurologists were not aware of warnings about four drug safety risks: suicidality with newer AEDs, increased birth defect risks from in utero divalproex exposure, impaired cognitive development from in utero divalproex exposure, and the requirement of haplotype screening in patients of Asian descent starting carbamazepine. Most respondents were aware of a recommendation for haplotype screening, yet did not routinely perform the safety screening, and 18 reported patients that had hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine. Respondents learned about drug safety risks from varied sources; only notifications from specialty organizations were associated with accurate knowledge of drug safety warnings. Most surveyed neurologists would prefer implementing \"a formal warning process via specialty organizations\" with e-mails of updated product insert warnings. ",

Secondary objective was defining possible \"groups of risk\" for people suffering recurrent positional vertigo related to the presence of a well documented comorbidity.METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter, spontaneous, non-pharmacological study. The data of 1092 patients suffering BPPV evaluated in 11 different Departments of Otolaryngology, Otoneurology and Neurology, referring Centers for positional vertigo evaluation, were retrospectively collected.RESULTS: Regarding evaluated comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and depression), data analysis showed the presence of at least one comorbid disorder in 216 subjects (19.8%) and 2 or more in 408 subjects (37.4%). Moreover there was a statistical significant difference between the number of comorbidities and the number of recurrences, otherwise said as comorbidity disorders increased the number of relapses increased too.CONCLUSION: The presence of a systemic disease may worsen the status of the posterior labyrinth causing a more frequent otolith detachment. This condition increases the risk for patients suffering BPPV to have recurrent episodes, even if correctly managed by repositioning maneuvers. The combination of two or more of aforementioned comorbidities further increases the risk of relapsing BPPV, worsened by the presence of osteoporosis. On the basis of this results it was possible to define \"groups of risk\" useful for predicting BPPV recurrence in patients with one or more comorbidity.",

It is an outcome of discussions about current knowledge, existing guidelines, and key issues during two Belgian consensus meetings attended by neurologists, urologists and other stakeholders involved in MS management. At these meetings, updated information on management of NLUTD in MS was exchanged and the neurologists' opinion on how to integrate this in the other aspects of care in MS patients was explored.RESULTS: Short evaluation of NLUTD in MS patients by neurologists and appropriate referral to urologists could accelerate proper diagnosis and treatment. Neurologists can play a central role in the inter-disciplinary communication on interactions between disease manifestations of MS and their treatments.CONCLUSION: The coordinating role of neurologists in NLUTD management may considerably improve QoL in MS patients. More research is needed to evaluate outcomes of urological assessments and treatment.",

The penetration of organic objects longer than 7 cm into the eye is a rare phenomenon. In this study, we report a case in which a 6-year-old boy fell on a pencil which penetrated the upper side of his right eye orbit. Because of the agitation of the child and the lack of access, it was not possible to perform a brain or orbital computed tomography (CT) scan, but an X-ray showed that the object had gone directly into the retro-orbital space. As the result of a clinical diagnosis, it was possible to ascertain that the globe was severely hypertonic. Throughout this process the child was extremely agitated. After consultation with the neurosurgery service, the patient was rushed to the operation room. After anesthesia and superanasal peritomy, the pencil was removed slowly from the orbit. Neurology and CT scans after surgery didn't show any ocular or brain symptoms. Once the patient's general condition had improved sufficiently and his visual acuity had returned to 10/10, he was discharged from the hospital. This case shows that even without specialized tests, such as CT scans, an organ can be saved.",

The former are frequently the earliest manifestation of NF1, and as such are of particular significance when assessing young children at risk of the condition. A phenotype of predominantly spinal neurofibromatosis has been identified in a small minority of families with NF1, often in association with a relative or absolute lack of cutaneous manifestations. An association with splicing and missense mutations has previously been reported for spinal neurofibromatosis, but on the basis of molecular results in only a few families.METHOD: Patients with spinal NF1 were identified through the Manchester nationally commissioned service for complex NF1.RESULTS: Five families with spinal NF1 were identified, with a broad spectrum of NF1 mutations, providing further evidence that this phenotype may arise in association with any genre of mutation in this gene. Pigmentary manifestations were absent or very mild in affected individuals. Several further affected individuals, some with extensive spinal root tumours, were ascertained when additional family members were assessed.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical NF1 consensus criteria cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis of spinal NF1, especially in childhood. This emphasises the importance of molecular confirmation in individuals and families with atypical presentations of NF1.",

This being the first Kenyan and sub-Saharan African study assessing quality of life among people living with epilepsy, it will identify their 'intangible' needs and enable evidence-based intervention that would ultimately lead to a comprehensive management and better outcome.DESIGN: A cross-sectional comparative study, using the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire, a socio-demographic questionnaire, seizure burden and characteristics, drug and treatment profile questionnaires and the Mini-Mental state examination, among PLWE and those accompanying them, herein referred to as the normal healthy controls, attending the neurology clinic at Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi.SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Study was carried out between October 2006 and February 2007 at the neurology clinic in the hospital where three hundred consecutive subjects who satisfied the inclusion criteria and gave consent were recruited.Statistical tests used: Descriptive statistics were used to compute means, standard deviations as well as frequencies. Significance of associations was tested using the Chi square test statistic (x2), an independent samples t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a step-wise (forward) regression analysis. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: The mean quality of life among people living with epilepsy (49.90%) was significantly (p < 0.01) lower than that of the normal controls (77.60%) accompanying them and significantly impaired as compared to the hypothesized mean of 75±2.5%. Factors significantly (p < 0.05) associated with impairment of quality of life in those living with epilepsy were a low level of education, higher seizure burden, low annual income, unemployment, unskilled employment, and living in a rural residence.CONCLUSIONS: The mean quality of life of people living with epilepsy at Kenyatta National Hospital was significantly impaired and lower than that of the normal controls accompanying them. A comprehensive epilepsy management program is recommended to address this problem and its associated risk factors for the people living with epilepsy in Kenya.",

Our clinical literature review suggested that analgesic overuse may be associated with elevated blood pressure (BP), so we performed the present study to investigate the frequency of elevated BP and its link with analgesic overuse in CDH and its subtypes.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in neurology outpatients with a diagnosis of CDH according to International Headache Society criteria. CDH patients were classified into CM and non-CM groups, and subclassified with or without analgesic overuse.RESULTS: Elevated BP was present in 27.96% of CDH patients. Compared with non-CM patients, patients with CM had a longer duration of headache and more severe pain intensity, and a family history of headache and analgesic overuse were also more common, but the elevated BP frequency was not different between the two groups. Almost one-third of the patients had analgesic overuse; 96.8% of which comprised acetaminophen-containing agents. Those with analgesic overuse had a higher frequency of headache than those without analgesic overuse in both the CM and non-CM groups.CONCLUSIONS: Although the CM patients had a longer duration of headache, more severe intensity, the frequency of elevated BP wasn't higher than non-CM group. Analgesic overuses maybe the reason of higher frequency of elevated BP in CDH and its subtypes. This may have predictive value for clinicians to improve CDH management.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) is a recessive disease that results in total neurological degeneration and death in childhood. PLA2G6 mutation is the underlying genetic defect, but rare genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated. One of the five families we studied did not link to PLA2G6 locus, and in the family one of the two affected siblings additionally had atypical features including facial dysmorphism, pectus carinatum, scoliosis, pes varus, zygodactyly and bilateral cryptorchidism as well as cerebellar atrophy, as previously reported.METHODS: Sural biopsy was investigated by electron microscopy. PLA2G6 was screened for mutations by Sanger sequencing. In the mutation-free family, candidate disease loci were found via linkage analysis using data from single nucleotide polymorphism genome scans. Exome sequencing was applied to find the variants at the loci.RESULTS: PLA2G6 mutations were identified in four families including the one with an unusually severe phenotype that led to death within the first 2 years of life. In the remaining family, seven candidate loci totalling 15.2 Mb were found and a homozygous truncating mutation p.Q642X was identified in NALCN at 13q32.3. The patients are around 20-years-old.CONCLUSIONS: NALCN is the gene responsible for INAD with facial dysmorphism. The patients have lived to adulthood despite severe growth and neuromotor retardation. NALCN forms a voltage-independent ion channel with a role in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Our findings broaden the spectrum of genes associated with neuroaxonal dystrophy. Testing infants with idiopathic severe growth retardation and neurodegeneration for NALCN mutations could benefit families.",

All these women delivered at our clinic and were neurologically followed until the end of six months post partum. We evaluated the influence of pregnancy on the activity of the disease during the pregnancy and 6 months after delivery, the impact on the disability progression, the influence of the mode of delivery, the analgesia used, and breastfeeding, on the relapse rate post partum. We also assessed the impact of multiple sclerosis on the course of the pregnancy, where we looked for pregnancy complications in patients with multiple sclerosis, differences in the management of labor, and the results of newborns of mothers with this disease. We performed a statistical analysis.RESULTS: Relapse during pregnancy occurred in 4 of the 66 women (6.1%, relapse rate - RR 0.1);17 women experienced a post partum relapse in the first six months after delivery (25.7%, RR 0.5). From our sample of 44 women breastfed (66.7%), 10 had relapse (10/44, 22.7%) in comparison with the 7 women out of a total of 22 who did not breastfed (7/22, 31.8%). No statistical significance was established, OR = 0.6 (0.2-2.0), p = 0.5518. Epidural analgesia (EDA) was used by 16 women (24.2%). Post partum relapse experienced 3 women that used EDA (3/16, 18.8%) and 14 women that did not use EDA (14/50, 28 %). OR = 0.6 (0.1-2.4), p = 0.5325. Neither breastfeeding, nor epidural analgesia correlated with presence of a post partum relapse. Pregnancy did not influence disability progression, EDSS (Disability status scale, Kurtzke`s scale) before pregnancy and after delivery was stable (EDSS 1.5 or EDSS 1.6). Vaginal delivery had 77% women, post partum relapse had 15 of them (15/50, 30%), 12 women (18.1%) had a caesarean section, relapse occure at 2 of them (2/16, 12.5%), three births (4.5%) were completed by vaginal extraction operations. Five women (7.6%) delivered before 37th week of pregnancy. Birth weight under 2500 g was found in 9 women (13.6%). The incidence of serious pregnancy complications was not increased, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was confirmed in 4 births (6%).CONCLUSION: There is no need to worry about pregnancy in patients with multiple sclerosis. Therapy provides long-term remission of the disease, and during pregnancy itself due to hormonal changes it is stabilized and the relapse rate decreases. In the post partum period relapse rate increases, however, the pregnancy did not influence disability progression. The mode of delivery in women with this disease is not different from the general population. Neither breastfeeding, nor epidural analgesia correlated with presence of a post partum relapses. The number of complications in pregnancy is not increased and the overall perinatal outcomes are comparable with the general population.",

Patients with Parkinson's disease with a disease duration of less than 5 years and mild to moderate severity along with healthy controls of the same age group were included. Those subjects with diabetes mellitus, hypertension or diagnosis of dysautonomia were excluded. Blood pressure was measured in supine position as well as after 3 and 5 min of standing.RESULTS: Seventy subjects with Parkinson's disease and 145 controls were included. There were no statistically significant differences in gender and age between both groups. There was no difference in systolic blood pressure change between groups at 3 minutes but at 5 minutes a statistically significant difference was found (P=.03). For diastolic blood pressure a difference between both groups was present at three and five minutes (P=.02 and P=.007).CONCLUSION: Patients with early Parkinson's disease have differences in orthostatic responses compared to healthy controls, these differences are more relevant at 5 minutes of standing.",

Their onset is variable from childhood to adulthood and presentation can be with a variety of clinical features that include mainly for adult-onset cases cognitive decline, seizures, parkinsonism, muscle weakness, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, personality/behavioral problems, and dystonia. Recently, Rademakers and colleagues identified mutations in the CSF1R gene as the cause of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS), offering the possibility for an in-life diagnosis. The detection of mutations in this gene in cases diagnosed with different clinical entities further demonstrated the difficulties in the clinical diagnosis of HDLS.OBJECTIVE: To better understand the genetic role of mutations in this gene, we sequenced a large cohort of adult-onset leukodystrophy cases.DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing and follow up-screening by Sanger sequencing.SETTING: Collaborative study between the Institute of Neurology, University College London and the Inserm, Paris, France.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 114 probands, mostly European patients, with a diagnosis of adult-onset leukodystrophy or atypical cases that could fit within a picture of leukodystrophy. These included 3 extended families within the spectrum of leukodystrophy phenotype.INTERVENTIONS: Whole-exome sequencing in a family and Sanger sequencing of CSF1R.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mutations in CSF1R.RESULTS: We identified 12 probands with mutations in CSF1R. The clinical diagnoses given to these patients included dementia with spastic paraplegia, corticobasal degeneration syndrome, and stroke disorders. Our study shows that CSF1R mutations are responsible for a significant proportion of clinically and pathologically proven HDLS.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results give an indication of the frequency of CSF1R mutations in a European leukodystrophy series and expand the phenotypic spectrum of disorders that should be screened for this gene.",

As in adults, the diagnosis of pediatric MS is a clinical one, requiring recurrent episodes of CNS demyelination with supportive paraclinical data (MRI findings, CSF characteristics) in the absence of another plausible diagnosis. The differential diagnosis is broad and, the more atypical the case and the younger the child, the more consideration is necessary before making a diagnosis of MS. MS must be differentiated from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO). After initial presentation with a CNS demyelinating event or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), children can meet the diagnostic criteria for MS if serial changes are noted on MRI and other disorders are excluded. Accurate diagnosis of pediatric MS is critical because of the implications of the diagnosis, including the need for long-term disease modifying therapy.",

Although stroke risk scores (CHADS2 and more recently CHA2DS2-VASc) have been validated in heterogeneous populations of patients with atrial fibrillation, their accuracy has not been ascertained for secondary stroke prevention. We set out to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk scores as predictors of cardioembolic sources, documented by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in a population with ischemic stroke.METHODS: The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were applied to all patients admitted to the stroke unit/neurology ward of a Portuguese tertiary hospital with atrial fibrillation (diagnosed previously or during or after admission) who underwent TEE between January and August 2011. The presence of a cardioembolic source was defined as the observation by TEE of spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium and atrial appendage or thrombi in the left cardiac chambers.RESULTS: We studied 94 patients, 66.0% male, mean age 64.4 years (standard deviation 14.2). A cardioembolic source was detected in 20 patients. ROC curve analysis identified as predictors of cardioembolic source CHADS2 score ?4 (sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 66.0%, p=0.014) and CHA2DS2-VASc score ?5 (sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 58.0%, p=0.009).CONCLUSIONS: Both scores showed acceptable sensitivity as predictors of embolic risk in the context of secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke. The CHA2DS2-VASc score has higher sensitivity than CHADS2 but lower specificity.",

It has also been used for other clinical research purposes in neurology and diabetes. However, its widespread use is limited by the short physical half-life of the radionuclide and a difficult radiosynthesis. Therefore, a Fluorine-18 labeled analogue, 5-[(18)F]Fluoro-L-tryptophan ([(18)F]FTRP), has been proposed as a functional analogue. There is no published method for the synthesis of L-[(18)F]FTRP. We have therefore developed a synthesis of 5-fluoro-[â-(11)C]-L-tryptophan ([(11)C]FTRP), based on the existing chemo-enzymatic method for [(11)C]HTP and evaluated the potential usefulness of radiolabeled FTRP as a substitute for [(11)C]HTP.METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo behavior of [(11)C]FTRP, including the dependence of key enzymes in the serotonergic metabolic pathway, was investigated in NET cell lines, NET xenograft carrying immunodeficient mice, normal rats and in non-human primate. [(11)C]HTP was used for direct comparison.RESULTS: Uptake of [(11)C]FTRP in NET cell lines in vitro was mediated by enzymes involved in serotonin synthesis and metabolism, similar to [(11)C]HTP. In vivo biodistribution, either in rodent or non-human primate, was not affected by selectively inhibiting enzymatic steps in the serotonergic metabolic pathway.CONCLUSION: [(11)C]FTRP has in vitro biological function similar to that of [(11)C]HTP. However, this function is not retained in vivo as shown by biodistribution and PET/CT studies. Radiolabeled FTRP is thus not likely to provide an advantage over [(11)C]HTP in PET imaging in oncology, neurology or diabetes.",

Being a subspecialty of both neurology and ophthalmology, it requires specialized training and expertise in diseases of the eye, brain, nerves and muscles. Commonly encountered pathologies in neuro-ophthalmology include: optic neuropathies (such as optic neuritis and ischemic optic neuropathy), visual field loss (transient, constant, unexplained), transient visual loss, unspecified visual disturbances, diplopia, abnormal eye movements, thyroid eye disease, myasthenia gravis, anisocoria, and eyelid abnormalities. The current issue of \"Harefuah\" is dedicated to contemporary knowledge in neuro-opthalmology, and spans from studies of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), ischemic optic neuropathies, and optic neuropathies induced by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, to the management of sight-threatening carotid-cavernous fistulas, and more. These studies emphasize the importance of an interdisciplinary treatment team consisting of a neuro-ophthalmologist, a neuro-radiologist, and sometimes, even a neuro-surgeon. Such an approach may prove to be beneficial to the patient, by optimizing follow-up and treatment decisions. This issue emphasizes how a correct and timely diagnosis is of paramount significance in patients with neuro-ophthalmological disorders.",

We describe a model of service using a Neurology Consulting Team in the intensive care unit setting. Medical records were reviewed from a 32-month cohort of Neurology Consulting Team referrals. Six hundred eighty-nine (19%) of 3719 patients admitted to the intensive care unit were assessed by the team. The most common diagnostic categories were seizures, neurosurgical, cerebrovascular, or central nervous system infection. Fifty-seven percent (350 of 615 patients) required mechanical ventilation. Cohort mortality was 7% vs 2% for the general intensive care population (P < 0.01). The team provided 4592 initial and subsequent consultations; on average there were five to six new consultations per week. Each patient had a median of two (interquartile range, 1 to 6) consultations during admission. Three quarters of the cohort required neurodiagnostic investigation (1625 tests), with each patient undergoing a median of two (range, 0 to 3) studies. Taken together, the subset of pediatric intensive care unit patients undergoing neurology consultation, investigation, and management represents a significant practice experience for trainees, which has implications for future curriculum development in both pediatric critical care medicine and pediatric neurology.",

At this time, however, only a few studies have reported on stroke prevention knowledge and health behaviors among hypertensive patients who have had an initial stroke. The purpose of this study was to determine stroke prevention knowledge and health behaviors and to analyze the association between these 2 variables among hypertensive stroke patients who have had an initial stroke.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: With the use of a descriptive correlational design, a sample of 112 hypertensive stroke patients was recruited from the departments of neurology of 3 hospitals in Guangzhou, China. Each patient completed 2 reliable, validated questionnaires, the Stroke Prevention Knowledge Questionnaire and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II. Data were collected during patients' hospital admission for stroke, within 2 days of stroke onset, and before they received stroke education. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine the correlations between the study variables. Multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to predict both the level of knowledge relating to stroke prevention and health behaviors.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The participants showed a relatively low level of stroke prevention knowledge and a moderate level of engagement in healthy behaviors. Pearson correlation coefficient between these 2 variables was 0.423 (P < .001). The results of multiple regression analysis showed that stroke prevention knowledge was positively influenced by education level; health behaviors were positively influenced by both gender and stroke prevention knowledge. Findings suggest that male hypertensive patients and those with a lower education level need targeted stroke education. Because knowledge was unrelated to behavior with respect to smoking, alcohol use, and low-salt diet, behavioral interventions should be explored to address these important risk factors among patients at risk for stroke.",

Their DNA was extracted and a database was filled considering technical, ethical and legal aspects. In order to have optimal biologic material the procedure was standardized between the surgical and research laboratory teams.RESULTS: The biopsy, transportation, processing and storage were standardized. 134 patients were included (67 male and 67 female) with an average age of 46.28 years (range 15-81). The most frequently biopsied tumor was the meningioma (42%). The integrity of the obtained material was determined by agarose gel electrophoretic analysis.CONCLUSION: the INNN biobank has a standardized system that biopsies, processes and stores optimum quality biologic material that will be the basis of future molecular studies.",

Children with epilepsy seen in a tertiary neurology clinic were contacted requesting bone health blood tests during winter of 2011. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels <20 ng/mL, and insufficiency between 21 and 29 ng/mL. One hundred thirty letters were sent, with 111 (85%) subsequently having blood tests performed. Vitamin D deficiency was identified in 24 (22%) of 111 and an additional 45 (41%) of 111 had vitamin D insufficiency. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified children on >2 antiepileptic drugs or with underlying genetic etiologies were more likely to have vitamin D deficiency. High proportion of children on long-term antiepileptic drugs in Queensland risk vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency despite living in the subtropics. Vitamin D monitoring and supplementation is important in the management of children on long-term antiepileptic drugs requiring tertiary care in Queensland. ",

A cohort of epileptic children from the city of Mersin was retrospectively investigated. All patients received care from the same Department of Pediatric Neurology. The epileptic cohort was divided into a drug-responsive epilepsy group and an intractable epilepsy group. Intractable epilepsy is defined as continued seizures in children despite adequate therapy with two or more antiepileptic drugs for more than 18 months. Strong univariate association was observed between intractability and several factors: age of onset, high initial seizure frequency, symptomatic etiology, mixed seizure types, previous history of status epilepticus, febrile and neonatal seizures, mental and motor developmental delay, multiple seizures in 1 day, electroencephalogram abnormalities, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and specific epileptic syndromes. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a previous history of epilepticus status, abnormal electroencephalogram results, and multiple seizures in 1 day comprise independent predictors of medically intractable childhood epilepsy. We suggest that medical intractability in childhood epilepsy can be predicted by monitoring these factors. Along with early prediction, alternative therapies may be designed to provide patients better seizure control and quality of life.",

While there is no ambiguity in the literature about the urgency of care for patients with MSCC, the effect of timing of surgical intervention has not been investigated in detail. The objective of our study was to investigate whether or not the 'timing of surgery' is an important factor in survival and neurological outcome in patients with MSCC.METHODS: All patients with MSCC presenting to our unit from October 2005 to March 2010 were included in this study. Patients were divided into three groups-those who underwent surgery within 24 h (Group 1, n = 45), between 24 and 48 h (Group 2, n = 23) and after 48 h (Group 3, n = 53) from acute presentation of neurological symptoms. The outcome measures studied were neurological outcome (change in Frankel grade post-operatively), survival (survival rate and median survival in days), incidence of infection, length of stay and complications.RESULTS: Patients' age, gender, revised Tokuhashi score, level of spinal metastasis and primary tumour type were not significantly different between the three groups. Greatest improvement in neurology was observed in Group 1, although not significantly when compared against Group 2 (24-48 h; (p = 0.09). When comparisons of neurological outcome were performed for all patients having surgery within 48 h (Groups 1 and 2) versus after 48 h (Group 3), the Frankel grade improvement was significant (p = 0.048) favouring surgery within 48 h of presentation. There was a negative correlation (-0.17) between the delay in surgery and the immediate neurological improvement, suggesting less improvement in those who had delayed surgery. There was no difference in length of hospital stay, incidence of infection, post-operative complications or survival between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that surgery should be performed sooner rather than later. Furthermore, earlier surgical treatment within 48 h in patients with MSCC resulted in significantly better neurological outcome. However, the timing of surgery did not influence length of hospital stay, complication rate or patient survival.",

In this pilot study, our aim was to demonstrate a simple and effective strategy for screening patients for exposure to abuse.METHODS: A total of 103 consecutive patients reporting to an academic neurology clinic specializing in autonomic and movement disorders were screened for a history of abuse and violence. A set of 6 questions were included in the standard patient intake questionnaire. The questions were then repeated verbally during the physician history taking. All patients were provided with information on available local resources for abuse counseling during the visit. Retrospective chart review analysis was performed to determine the prevalence of history of abuse in the population, the most common type of abuse suffered, and the number of individuals reporting current abuse.RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 103 patients (21%) screened for abuse reported exposure to abuse or violence. Two patients with ongoing issues with abuse were identified. The most commonly reported abuse was being a witness to violence (65%), followed by physical abuse (41%), sexual and emotional abuse (36% each), and financial abuse (23%). The neurological disorders most frequently observed in these patients were chronic pain, neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, headache, and Parkinson disease.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neurological disorders may have been exposed to abuse and violence. It is important to recognize these issues and address them routinely in the neurological evaluation. A simple, effective way to accomplish screening in the outpatient setting is through the use of an intake questionnaire combined with verbal clarification.",

It was determined that the patient needs shunting during the CEA by intraoperative monitoring of patient's neurology. All patients were divided into two subgroups: shunt group or no-shunt group. Imaging findings on preoperative MRA were correlated to shunting using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses combined with patient's demographic and clinical features to identify predictors of cerebral ischemia during the CEA.RESULTS: In 37 of 382 CEA cases (9.7%), shunting had been performed intraoperatively because the patient had a neurologic deficit. At multivariate analysis, preoperative MRA findings such as the absence of patent communicating arteries (odds ratio [OR], 5.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.05-9.69; p = 0.013) and the increase of intracranial arteries which were not patent in the contralateral hemisphere (OR, 4.277; 95% CI, 2.575 to 7.104; p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with shunting.CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative MRA is valuable when predicting cerebral ischemia leading to an inevitable shunting during CEA. Therefore, if there are preoperative MRA findings such as multiple occlusive intracranial arteries in the contralateral hemisphere or the absence of patent communicating arteries, it is recommended that CEA be performed under general anesthesia with routine shunting to avoid a serious shunt-related complication.",

The surgical interventions were single-jaw versus double-jaw procedures.STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four adult patients with skeletal class III deformity presented with functional and esthetic problems. Patients were randomized to receive single- or double-jaw corrective surgery. The assessment of outcome was by lateral cephalograms taken at different intervals and postoperative complications.RESULTS: At 1 year after surgery, no significant correlation was identified between surgical advancement and relapse regarding maxillary stability. The single-jaw procedure cohort had a significantly greater horizontal mandibular skeletal relapse. No differences were noted when examining the mandibular vertical stability. None of the patients reported any acute local neurology.CONCLUSIONS: Single-jaw procedure may lead to less stability, leading to skeletal relapse, than double-jaw procedure. A higher evidence-based study and larger cohort is required to prove this.",

The aim and purpose of this study was analysis of clinical picture in patients with acute polyradiculoneuritis and their differential diagnosis into patients with GBS or meningoradiculoneuritis within the framework of neuroborreliosis. In this retrospective study, medical records of patients with acute polyradiculoneuritis hospitalized at University Department of Neurology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center during a 4-year period were analyzed. The study included data on 27 patients. Definitive diagnosis ofGBS was made in 23 patients and of neuroborreliosis in four (14.8%) patients. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was recorded in 69% of GBS patients, Miller Fisher syndrome in four patients, and acute motor axonal neuropathy and/or acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy in three patients. Clinically, patients with neuroborreliosis manifested flaccid tetraparesis, peripheral facial nerve paresis, bulbar paresis, ocular motility disorders, and sensory symptoms of radicular pain and paresthesias. Considering the relatively high prevalence of neuroborreliosis in north-west Croatia, it is important to exclude meningoradiculoneuritis caused by Borrelia burgdorferi on differential diagnosis of GBS in these patients.",

The patient sought medical advice in neurology and ophthalmology clinics before being referred to the ear, nose and throat clinic. CT imaging revealed isolated opacification and expansion of both sphenoid sinuses with bony continuity along the periphery of the sinuses features consistent with mucocele. MRI was needed to fully evaluate the extension of the lesion. The lesion was diagnosed as bilateral sphenoid sinuses mucoceles. Transnasal endoscopic drainage of the sphenoid mucoceles leads to gradual improvement of the symptoms.

Recent genetic studies suggest that the rs1182 polymorphism in the same gene may represent a risk factor for primary dystonia. However, this finding has been inconsistent. Furthermore, no data on such an association in a Chinese population have been published.METHODS: A total of 291 patients with primary dystonia from the Department of Neurology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University were included. From the same region, 294 healthy individuals were recruited as a control group. The SNP was identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.RESULTS: In the present study, focal dystonia was the most common presented form. No difference was found in the genotype frequency, minor allele frequencies, and \"G\" allele frequency between all dystonia patients and controls. No difference was found either, between early- and late-onset dystonia patients, patients with and without a positive family history, patients with pain and without pain, and patients with and without sensory trick. Moreover, no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies were found among different dystonia subtypes.CONCLUSION: No association of the rs1182 of TOR1A with Chinese primary dystonia was found. More studies on such an association involving a larger number of participants, especially from Asian populations, are needed to confirm the present findings.",

Here, we report on presurgical patients grouped according to their underlying pathology by giving results of presurgical evaluation, surgical therapy and long-term follow-up between 1989-2009 and describe trends over this period.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of prospectively documented presurgical patients were retrospectively analysed. Trends were evaluated by a year-by-year analysis.RESULTS: 2684 presurgical patients underwent presurgical work-up, 1721 of whom (64.1%) went on to resective surgery. The largest presurgical/surgical group was mediotemporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (29.5%/35.4%). Of all operated patients, 1160 (67.4%) had a follow-up of ? 2 years. A total of 586 were continuously seizure-free without auras (50.5%; benign tumours: 61.0%; focal cortical dysplasia: 57.6%; mediotemporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis: 49.4%; non-lesional: 27.6%). Based on the number of the presurgically studied patients, we calculated as a novel measure of the effect of a presurgical/surgical programme an 'intention-to treat seizure-freedom' rate of 32.4%. Over time, the number of patients undergoing evaluation, but also of those not suitable or agreeable for invasive measures increased. Annual numbers of resective procedures remained stable. Average epilepsy duration of patients admitted for presurgical assessment increased. The proportion of patients with benign tumours declined. Intracranial studies and MRI-histopathology discrepancies decreased. Seizure-freedom rates remained constant.CONCLUSIONS: Epilepsy surgery is highly effective, especially in patients with clearly defined focal pathologies. At this specialised centre, there is a trend towards growing numbers of difficult patients and increasing epilepsy duration prior to referral for presurgical assessment.",

      "abstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the needed workforce of trained neurointerventionalists (NIs) to perform endovascular therapy (ET) for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).METHOD: Population and ischemic stroke incidence data were extracted with use of US Census and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009 estimates. The annual \"demand\" is defined as the proportion of AIS patients who would meet inclusion criteria and clinical standards for ET. The \"supply\" is defined as the number of trained NIs and NIs in training. The \"workforce\" is the number of NIs needed to meet the demand (the number of eligible AIS patients) within an accessible geographic diameter. Data on NIs and NI fellowships were collected (Society of Neurointerventional Surgery [SNIS], Society of Vascular & Interventional Neurology [SVIN], Concentric Medical, and Penumbra Inc.).RESULTS: The estimated number of NIs is close to 800, practicing within a 50-mile radius of major metropolitan areas in the United States, covering more than 95% of the US population. Approximately 40 NI fellows are graduating yearly from US training programs. In 5 years and 10 years, the number of NIs may reach 1,000 and 1,200, respectively. Currently, there are approximately 14,000 thrombectomy procedures performed in the United States each year. However, the percentage of AIS patients who may be eligible for ET in our estimation is 4% to 14%, or about 25,000 to 95,000 patients. This means that cases will occur at a rate of 26 to 97 per year in 5 years, or 22 to 81 per year in 10 years, for each NI. Providing 24/7 AIS coverage requires 2 to 3 NIs per medical center, adding to the challenge of providing manpower without diluting experience in areas of lower population density.CONCLUSION: The current and projected number of NIs would adequately supply the future need if the proportion of patients requiring AIS endovascular therapy increases. However, 2 to 3 NIs per comprehensive stroke center would be needed to provide 24/7 AIS therapy with a sufficient number of cases per NI. A tertiary stroke center model similar to the trauma model may provide the manpower solution without compromising the quality of care.",

The pneumocephalus was associated with Haemophilus influenzae otitis media and reactive meningitis in the absence of an intracranial brain abscess. Myeloma causes thinning of bone trabeculae and destructive lytic bone lesions. This can predispose to a risk of pathologic fractures and, in patients with skull vault involvement, to the rare complication of pneumocephalus. Therefore, pneumocephalus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute headache in patients with multiple myeloma, especially those with skull vault involvement. Prompt computed tomography and liaison between the otolaryngology and neurology teams may assist in making an early diagnosis and preventing life-threatening intracranial complications.",

The aims of this study were to investigate binaural auditory processing in individuals with axonal (Friedreich ataxia) and demyelinating (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A) auditory neuropathy and to evaluate the relationship between the degree of auditory deficit and overall clinical severity in patients with neuropathic disorders. Twenty-three subjects with genetically confirmed Friedreich ataxia and 12 subjects with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A underwent psychophysical evaluation of basic auditory processing (intensity discrimination/temporal resolution) and binaural speech perception assessment using the Listening in Spatialized Noise test. Age, gender and hearing-level-matched controls were also tested. Speech perception in noise for individuals with auditory neuropathy was abnormal for each listening condition, but was particularly affected in circumstances where binaural processing might have improved perception through spatial segregation. Ability to use spatial cues was correlated with temporal resolution suggesting that the binaural-processing deficit was the result of disordered representation of timing cues in the left and right auditory nerves. Spatial processing was also related to overall disease severity (as measured by the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score) suggesting that the degree of neural dysfunction in the auditory system accurately reflects generalized neuropathic changes. Measures of binaural speech processing show promise for application in the neurology clinic. In individuals with auditory neuropathy due to both axonal and demyelinating mechanisms the assessment provides a measure of functional hearing ability, a biomarker capable of tracking the natural history of progressive disease and a potential means of evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.",

There is little scientific support for many of the recommended interventions and there is evidence that at least some methods now used in the field and emergency department are harmful. Since prospective clinical trials are not likely to resolve these issues I propose a reconceptualisation of spinal trauma to allow a more rational approach to treatment. To do this I analyse the basic physics, biomechanics and physiology involved. I then develop a list of recommended treatment variations that are more in keeping with the actual causes of post impact neurological deterioration than are current methods. Discarding the fundamentally flawed emphasis on decreasing post injury motion and concentrating on efforts to minimise energy deposition to the injured site, while minimising treatment delays, can simplify and streamline care without subjecting patients to procedures that are not useful and potentially harmful. Specific treatments that are irrational and which can be safely discarded include the use of backboards for transportation, cervical collar use except in specific injury types, immobilisation of ambulatory patients on backboards, prolonged attempts to stabilise the spine during extrication, mechanical immobilisation of uncooperative or seizing patients and forceful in line stabilisation during airway management.

Two groups were evaluated with either CT or MRI; the two groups were independent and no individual underwent both CT and MRI.RESULTS: One hundred and twelve consecutive cerebral MRI and 204 consecutive CT examinations were identified. Three (2.7%) individuals had brain lesions [brain tumour and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalopathy] potentially accountable for the psychosis at MRI. Seventy patients (62.5%) had incidental brain lesions, such as cerebral atrophy, small vessel ischaemic changes, unruptured Circle of Willis aneurysm, cavernoma, and arachnoid cysts at MRI. Three patients (1.5%) had focal brain lesions (primary or secondary tumours) potentially accountable for the psychosis at CT. One hundred and thirty-three patients (65.2%) had incidental brain lesions unrelated to the psychosis on CT scan. There was no significant difference between MRI and CT imaging in detecting organic disease potentially responsible for FEP (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Routine MRI or CT imaging of the brain is unlikely to reveal disease leading to a significant change in management. MRI was comparable with CT in terms of diagnosis of both pathological and incidental cerebral lesions. Therefore, routine brain structural imaging of FEP in patients without focal neurology may not be routinely required and if imaging is requested then CT may function equally as well as MRI as the first-line investigation.",

We performed a descriptive analysis of quantity of consults, response times, sites where consults originated, military branches that benefitted, anatomic locations of problems, and diagnoses.METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis that searched electronic databases for neurology consults from October 2006 to December 2010 and TBI consults from March 2008 to December 2010.RESULTS: A total of 508 consults were received for neurology, and 131 consults involved TBI. For the most part, quantity of consults increased over the years. Meanwhile, response times decreased, with a mean response time of 8 hours, 14 minutes for neurology consults and 2 hours, 44 minutes for TBI consults. Most neurology consults originated in Iraq (67.59%) followed by Afghanistan (16.84%), whereas TBI consults mainly originated from Afghanistan (40.87%) followed by Iraq (33.91%). The most common consultant diagnoses were headaches, including migraines (52.1%), for neurology cases and mild TBI/concussion (52.3%) for TBI cases. In the majority of cases, consultants recommended in-theater management. After receipt of consultant's recommendation, 84 known neurology evacuations were facilitated, and 3 known neurology evacuations were prevented.CONCLUSIONS: E-mail-based neurology and TBI subspecialty teleconsultation is a viable method for overseas providers in remote locations to receive expert recommendations for a range of neurologic conditions. These recommendations can facilitate medically necessary patient evacuations or prevent evacuations for which on-site care is preferable.",

To our knowledge, his work might have been the first to systematically investigate the epidemiology of cerebrovascular accidents, with the aim of shedding light on the underlying causes.METHODS: A detailed analysis of the essay \"Statistics of sudden deaths, more particularly of deaths from apoplexy, in the city and neighborhood of Milan, from 1750 to 1834,\" published by Ferrario in 1834.RESULTS: Ferrario conducted a large retrospective study on 13,360 people who died from apoplexy during an 84-year observational period. Analyzed data showed that these events were more frequent among men and during winter. Apoplexy was reported as mainly occurring at the age of 60; an increase in mortality was observed in young women aged between 21 and 30 years, probably due to an abuse of bloodletting. Ferrario introduced the term \"hereditary apoplexy,\" being one of the first to hypothesize hereditary components in cerebrovascular diseases. He also tried to investigate the role of social conditions in the etiopathogenesis of these events, analyzing marital and employment status and suggesting to his colleagues that cultural and economic factors should be further examined.CONCLUSIONS: Giuseppe Ferrario may be considered as a pioneer of modern science and epidemiology and his work deserves consideration within the history of neurology and of neuroepidemiology.",

Our objective was to determine the incidence of motor fluctuations in a retrospective cohort of Mexican patients with Parkinson's disease.METHODS: we reviewed the files of 584 cases of Parkinson's disease patients treated at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery between 1990 and 2010. We registered the demographic and clinical data to analyze the disease course.RESULTS: the follow-up was of 4736 person-years. 33.9 % of patients (n = 198) had motor fluctuations at some point in the evolution of the disease. The rate of person-time incidence was 43 cases per 1000 person-years. The daily dose of levodopa equivalents greater than 600 mg/d and the use of levodopa were the main risk factors for early development of motor fluctuations (HR 1.40 [95 % CI = 1.07 to 1.83, p < 0.001] and HR 1.61 [95 % CI = 1.17 to 2.23, p = 0.004], respectively).CONCLUSIONS: the main determinants of early development of motor fluctuations are the levodopa equivalent daily dose and the quantity and early use of levodopa.",

Information on demographics, hospital characteristics, and comorbidities was collected. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of morbidity, mortality, and intracranial hemorrhage.RESULTS: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator utilization increased from 1·3% in 2001 to 3·5% in 2008. On multivariate analysis, variables associated with increased morbidity after intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator administration included advanced age (P < 0·001), female gender (P < 0·001), and comorbidities of atrial fibrillation (P < 0·001) and hypertension (P < 0·001). Increased mortality was associated with increased age (P < 0·001) and comorbidities of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes (P < 0·001 for all comorbidities).CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator utilization rates increased between 2001 and 2008. Advanced age and atrial fibrillation were significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality among patients treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.",

During the visit, the mother mentioned that she had observed jerking movements of the limbs, arms more than legs. Various tests were performed and observation in the ward helped determine the characteristics of the seizure-like movements. The infant was born by vaginal delivery with vacuum extraction with a history of possible perinatal asphyxia. After seizures were observed in the ward, the patient was referred to neurology where an EEG was performed. It was normal, excluding epilepsy states. A normal newborn screen excluded most metabolic disorders. After history and examination, investigations and observation, benign sleep myoclonus was diagnosed. Benign sleep myoclonus is a benign disorder that consists of jerking movements of the limbs, usually involving the upper limbs more than the lower limbs and usually occurring during sleep. The seizures spontaneously stopped when the infant was approximately 1.5 months old. This was consistent with the final diagnosis of neonatal sleep myoclonus.",

A correlation analysis was carried out to determine if the presence of depression and anxiety was related to the adverse effects of AEDs. The relation between LAEP scores with other epidemiological variables was also assessed.RESULTS: Our study found a positive correlation between the LAEP and the HADS scores (p < or = 0.01). The most common adverse effects were drowsiness (81.5% [n=106]), difficulty in concentrating (76% [n=99]), and nervousness and/or agitation (75% [n=97]). Female gender, a history of febrile seizures, persistent seizures and polytherapy were associated with a higher toxicity on LAEP. In our study, age at epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, type of epilepsy and patients' age were not related to higher LAEP scores.CONCLUSION: Adverse effects to AEDs can be related with the presence of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression in patients with epilepsy.",

The research was carried out qualitatively with those who were responsible for the care of eight Alzheimer patients who were being treated at the Neurology Polyclinics of Gevher Nesibe Hospital at Erciyes University in Kayseri, Turkey. Research data were collected through questionnaires designed to understand the characteristics of the individuals who provided care and focus group interviews. A written consent from the institution and an oral as well as written consent of the individuals were obtained. Focus groups were interviewed in the same setting at different times with two different groups, including four people who agreed to participate in the research. Each interview was conducted by three personnel: a moderator, a reporter, and an observer. Interviews were structured under four main titles: \"The changes seen in the individual with Alzheimer disease\"; \"Physical, social, psychological, and socioeconomical problems that caregivers experienced\"; \"Precautions taken against the problems\"; and \"Patients' expectations of the care\". The interviews lasted for approximately 2 hours. A voice recorder and a written registration form were also used to collect information. Six women and two men constituted the research group. The caregivers stated that the patients had such difficulties as forgetfulness, nervousness, jealousy, childish behavior, deterioration in speech, fear of water, hallucinations, and difficulty in carrying out daily life activities. Caregivers emphasized the fact that they perceived the changes in the patients as deliberate behaviors and thus became annoyed and quarreled with them before diagnosis; however, after diagnosis, they felt remorse and experienced guilt because of their ill-treatment of them. In addition, the caregivers hid the patients and their disease from social surroundings. Caregivers mentioned that they had felt as someone who was helpless, exhausted, and abandoned; they lost their freedom and lacked their taste for life. They felt no confidence in someone else caring for the patient; thus, they neglected their own personal needs. Caregivers reported that they often cried and started to smoke because of these problems. They took precautions, such as making identity cards, helping the patients with their daily life activities, not changing the current order at home, and not leaving the patients alone. Caregivers expressed a desire for assistance from home healthcare personnel, a reliable nursing home where they could leave the patient, and a support group to whom they could share their problems. It was found that the caregivers who provided care to patients with Alzheimer disease experienced multidimensional problems, could not find any professional support, and needed institutional assistance.",

The purpose of this study was to validate the Taiwan Triage and Acuity Scale (TTAS) for stratifying patients according to their severity, need for thrombolysis, resource utilisation, and outcome.METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed all admitted patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke from January 2010 to September 2011. Presenting complaints, activation of code stroke protocol, eligibility of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator treatment, time from ED arrival to treatment, and outcome at discharge were compared by the five-level triage system.RESULTS: Of 706 enrolled patients (level 1, 55; level 2, 455; level 3, 192; level 4, 4; level 5, 0), there were 412 (58.4%) men and 294 women (41.6%), with a mean age of 69.4 years. The initial stroke severity, time from onset to arrival, time from arrival to imaging, proportion of patients for whom code stroke protocol was activated, length of hospital stay, and good functional outcome at discharge correlated with TTAS levels. A total of 84 patients were thrombolysis candidates, and 98.8% of them were designated as either level 1 or level 2. For those treated with thrombolytic therapy (n=47), the time from arrival to thrombolysis was not significantly different between TTAS level 1 and 2.CONCLUSION: Acuity measured by the computerised TTAS demonstrated good validity in facilitating acute care of stroke patients with special regard to thrombolytic therapy.",

According to WHO, the EPP is designed to help patients to maintain or gain self-care skills and adaptive skills necessary to improve their health and their quality of life. Patient education programs have been developed in recent years in several chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma. In the field of epilepsy, however, adult and child programs have been developed only recently in France. We evaluate the interests for the establishment of an EPP and the topics that the parents and the adolescents would like to be discussed in such courses.METHODS: We conducted a qualitative survey, based on interviews of parents of epileptic children and adolescents. The survey was conducted between April and November 2010 in pediatric neurology services of four French university hospitals: Amiens, Nancy, Marseille, and in Robert Debr? (Paris) hospital. We investigated the following issues: treatment and self-management, and seizure management, psychosocial difficulties related to epilepsy, anatomical and physiological knowledge of epilepsy and lifestyle.RESULTS: Two topics seem to have the greatest interest for parents of children with epilepsy and adolescents: knowledge about seizures and knowledge of anatomy and physiology of the brain. Adolescents involved in this study gave consistently lower scores in all items compare to parents of children.CONCLUSION: The medical management of children and adolescents with epilepsy, and their caregivers, is a comprehensive care including the EPP in order to provide a full management of all issues raised by epilepsy. The survey identified key-points that parents and their children would like to learn in an EPP. These data would be helpful to design an EPP.",

Elapsed time from symptom onset to the first visit was 24 months in the BS group and 59.7 months in the HFS group. Diagnosis was given on the first visit for 76.5% of the BS patients and 90.7% of the HFS patients. Patients were referred by their primary care centres in 34.6% of the cases with BS and in 77.6% of the cases with HFS. The most commonly used BtA preparation was BOTOX(®) in both groups, and there were no cases of primary or secondary resistance. The median dose of BtA was raised gradually in both groups, and the increase was statistically significant during the early years of treatment. The most common side effect was ptosis (47.1% in BS, 32.5% in HFS).CONCLUSIONS: BS and HFS are the most common facial movement disorders. The demographic and clinical characteristics and therapeutic findings from this study show that treatment with BtA is both effective and safe over the long term.",

Sporadic cases with atypical presentation have been described.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report clinical and pathological findings from 31 patients with IgM-related neuropathy followed in our Institute of Neurology over a 20-year period.RESULTS: Typical presentation with predominant sensory ataxic neuropathy was observed in 18/31 patients. In the remaining 13/31 (42%), we observed an atypical phenotype, characterized by multiple mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy with predominant motor impairment; one patient had polyneuropathy with predominant small-fibre involvement. Uncommon pathological findings consisting in inflammatory infiltrates, focal axonal loss or light chain deposition were observed in 8 patients, all with atypical clinical phenotype. Almost all patients with atypical phenotype improved with immunosuppressive therapy.CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients with IgM-related neuropathy presents with atypical clinical features. In these patients, sural nerve biopsy helps clarify heterogeneous disease mechanisms and identify patients who might benefit from immunosuppressive therapy.",

Therefore, it is essential to balance therapy discontinuation against risks of epilepsy recurrence. However, the risk factors predicting recurrence are yet to be identified. The present study was conducted in order to determine the rate of recurrence after gradual therapy discontinuation as well as its influential factors in epileptic patients under medical therapy who were seizure-free for a period of 2 years.METHOD AND MATERIALS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study on epileptic patients who referred to the specialized neurology clinic of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences from 1994 to 2010. The data were extracted from patients' medical records and analyzed.FINDINGS: A total of 391 patients were evaluated. In our study, 51.2% of patients experienced recurrence of seizure at the end of the 2-year follow-up. Recurrence occurred most frequently during medication tapering (51%). While the largest number of patients were aged under 12 years (178 patients; 45%), the rate of recurrence was greatest for patients aged 20-40 years (43 patients; 66.2%).DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: As our findings suggest, type of epilepsy, multidrug therapy, abnormal electroencephalography before discontinuation, and abnormal brain computed tomography scan are factors that influence the risk of recurrence after therapy discontinuation. It is essential for the physician to take these factors into account and weigh the risk of recurrence against the benefits of therapy discontinuation.",

      "abstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Last year the European Society of Echocardiography published recommendations for the use of echocardiography in identifying potential sources of embolism as a cause of ischemic stroke in the absence of other cerebrovascular diseases. Both transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography play a fundamental role in the assessment, diagnosis and management of the embolic source. Due in part to the increased longevity of the population and improved survival of cardiac patients, we are now seeing a gradual increase in the application of echocardiographic studies as a diagnostic test. This has led us to critically analyse their performance in detecting various pathologies.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyse the diagnostic yield of transthoracic echocardiography in patients with cerebrovascular accident in a tertiary hospital.MATERIAL AND METHODS: To this end, we retrospectively analysed all echocardiographic studies during 2010 requested from the Neurology Department with a diagnosis of stroke. We have studied the diagnostic yield of the test and its contribution to the etiological diagnosis based on major and minor echocardiographic criteria as recommended by the European Society of Echocardiography.RESULTS: We found major echocardiographic criteria in 6 patients (5%) with embolic stroke and in 2 (0.7%) non embolic, P=.005. In view of our results, the performance of transthoracic echocardiography in patients with embolic stroke has a low diagnostic yield, which leads us to question systematic use of this technique.",

In only three subspecialties (lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hearing loss) were 10 or fewer journals needed to locate 50% of trials. The scatter was less for systematic reviews: hearing loss had the least scatter (10 reviews across nine journals) and cancer the most (670 reviews across 279 journals). For some specialties and subspecialties the papers were concentrated in specialty journals; whereas for others, few of the top 10 journals were a specialty journal for that area. Generally, little overlap occurred between the top 10 journals publishing trials and those publishing systematic reviews. The number of journals required to find all trials or reviews was highly correlated (r = 0.97) with the number of papers for each specialty/subspecialty.CONCLUSIONS: Publication rates of speciality relevant trials vary widely, from one to seven trials per day, and are scattered across hundreds of general and specialty journals. Although systematic reviews reduce the extent of scatter, they are still widely scattered and mostly in different journals to those of randomised trials. Personal subscriptions to journals, which are insufficient for keeping up to date with knowledge, need to be supplemented by other methods such as journal scanning services or systems that cover sufficient journals and filter articles for quality and relevance. Few current systems seem adequate.",

Multidisciplinary inpatient approaches are employed in some centres for patients with severe refractory symptoms, but their efficacy and, in particular, long-term outcomes are uncertain. We conducted a study using questionnaires completed retrospectively by patients treated at a specialised multidisciplinary inpatient programme at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. Consecutive patients with functional motor symptoms admitted to this centre between 2006 and 2008 were invited to participate. Questionnaires were sent at least 2 years after discharge. We contacted 32 patients, and 26 responded. The majority had symptoms for at least 3 years prior to admission; 58 % of patients reported benefit from the programme on discharge. This self-reported benefit to symptoms and function was after a 2-year follow-up period in the majority of patients, but return to work or cessation of health-related financial benefits was uncommon even in those who improved. Seventy-four percent of those questioned stated they would recommend the programme to others with similar symptoms. Attribution of symptoms to stress or emotional state was correlated with favourable outcome. Our data suggest that multidisciplinary inpatient treatment for patients with refractory functional motor symptoms provides self-reported benefit in the long-term. Prospective analysis of such interventions and the determinants of benefit need assessment in order to improve the service and target treatment to patients most likely to benefit.",

Differences in the times and errors between baseline and follow-up K-D scores were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: Residents taking call had less improvement from baseline K-D times when compared to participants not taking call (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). For both groups, the change in K-D time from baseline was correlated to amount of sleep obtained (r(s) = -0.50, p = 0.002) and subjective evaluation of level of alertness (r(s) = 0.33, p = 0.05) but had no correlation to time since last caffeine consumption (r(s) = -0.13, p = 0.52). For those residents on their actual call night, the duration of sleep obtained did not correlate with change in K-D scores from baseline (r(s) = 0.13, p = 0.54).CONCLUSIONS: The K-D test is sensitive to the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive functioning, including rapid eye movements, concentration, and language function. As with other measures of sleep deprivation, K-D performance demonstrated significant interindividual variability in vulnerability to sleep deprivation. Severe fatigue appears to reduce the degree of improvement typically observed in K-D testing.",

The effects are expressed in most organ systems, and most involve the nervous system. Typical manifestations include structural abnormalities (eg, rapidly progressive cerebellar atrophy), myopathies (including congenital muscular dystrophies and limb-girdle dystrophies), strokes and stroke-like episodes, epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and demyelinating neuropathy. Patients can also have neurological symptoms associated with coagulopathies, immune dysfunction with or without infections, and cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure, which are common features of glycosylation disorders. The diagnosis of congenital disorder of glycosylation should be considered for any patient with multisystem disease and in those with more specific phenotypic features. Measurement of concentrations of selected glycoconjugates can be used to screen for many of these disorders, and molecular diagnosis is becoming more widely available in clinical practice. Disease-modifying treatments are available for only a few disorders, but all affected individuals benefit from early diagnosis and aggressive management.",

The two groups were compared under four main headings: interpersonal care, access to care, information and coordination of care.RESULTS: The principal finding was that interpersonal care was significantly worse in the off-trial group (P = 0.0001), implying a beneficial trial effect on patient experience.CONCLUSION: The effect observed is likely secondary to trial participation; both groups had similar baseline features, and were treated in the same way. Likely mechanisms for the differences are protocol, care and Hawthorne effects. The findings support the incorporation of structured RCT-style practice into routine clinical management, in order to deliver a more patient-centred care in the treatment of MS relapses. This may have implications for other chronic neurological diseases.",

Twelve subjects with FTD had an FTLD-TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathology, 15 had an FTLD-tau pathology, and 1 subject showed an FTLD-fused in sarcoma protein pathology. Receiver operating curve statistics were used to determine the diagnostic value of the oculomotor variables. Neuroanatomical correlates of oculomotor abnormalities were investigated using voxel-based morphometry.SETTING: Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 28 subjects with autopsy-confirmed FTD, 10 subjects with autopsy-confirmed AD, and 27 age-matched normal controls.RESULTS: All subjects with FTD or AD were impaired relative to normal controls on the antisaccade task. However, only FTLD-tau and AD cases displayed reflexive visually guided saccade abnormalities. The AD cases displayed prominent increases in horizontal saccade latency that differentiated them from the FTD cases. Impairments in velocity and gain were most severe in individuals with progressive supranuclear palsy but were also present in other tauopathies. By using vertical and horizontal saccade velocity and gain as our measures, we were able to differentiate patients with progressive supranuclear palsy from other patients. Vertical saccade velocity was strongly correlated with dorsal midbrain volume.CONCLUSION: Decreased visually guided saccade velocity and gain are suggestive of underlying tau pathology in FTD, with vertical saccade abnormalities most diagnostic of progressive supranuclear palsy.",

The SID and SIVD groups were recruited from the Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical University between October 2010 and September 2011. And the NC group came from Medical Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University over the same period. The vascular risk factors of all participants were assessed by the Framingham scale. Depression symptoms were assessed by the geriatric depression scale (GDS) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) while cognitive functions by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive clock drawing task (CDT).RESULTS: Both the SID (12.3 ± 4.7) and SIVD (13.5 ± 3.4) groups showed significantly higher Framingham scores than the NC group (8.6 ± 1.8) (F = 20.850, P = 0.000). Compared with the NC group (28.3 ± 1.8; 23.1 ± 3.4; 8.0 ± 1.8), the MMSE, MoCA and CDT scores were significantly lower in the SID (26.7 ± 2.5; 20.0 ± 4.0; 2.0 ± 2.7) and SIVD (26.8 ± 1.9; 20.7 ± 3.0; 6.1 ± 2.1) groups (P < 0.05). There were significantly lower CAMCOG-C scores in the SID (82.7 ± 9.0) and SIVD (86.2 ± 6.9) groups versus the NC group (92.3 ± 6.2) (P < 0.05) and similarly in the SID group versus the SIVD group (P < 0.05). Among the subtests of CAMCOG-C, the orientation, language and memory scores in both SID (9.0 ± 1.4; 24.7 ± 4.0; 19.5 ± 3.4) and SIVD (9.4 ± 0.9; 25.5 ± 2.1; 20.3 ± 2.3) groups were significantly lower than those in the NC group (9.9 ± 0.4; 27.4 ± 1.9; 22.1 ± 2.4) (P < 0.05); the praxis scores in the SID group (9.4 ± 1.9) were significantly lower than those in the NC group (10.4 ± 1.5) (P < 0.05). And the thinking and perception scores in the SID group (5.4 ± 1.7; 6.3 ± 1.4) were significantly lower than those in the SIVD (6.2 ± 1.3; 7.0 ± 1.4) and NC (6.6 ± 1.3; 7.2 ± 1.4) groups. In the SID group, no significant correlation was found between the Framingham scores and neuropsychological assessments. There were a negative correlation between the GDS, HAMD scores and MMSE, MoCA, CAMCOG-C and CDT scores (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The SID patients demonstrate multiple neuropsychological deficits, especially in thinking, perception and praxis. No significant correlation between vascular risk factors and depression symptoms is found in SID patients.",

In this context, providing publicly available data on animal toxins has become essential. The UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Tox-Prot program (http://www.uniprot.org/program/Toxins) plays a crucial role by providing such an access to venom protein sequences and functions from all venomous species. This program has up to now curated more than 5000 venom proteins to the high-quality standards of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (release 2012_02). Proteins targeted by these toxins are also available in the knowledgebase.

      "abstractText": "AIMS: Wilson's disease (WD) is a progressive degeneration of hepatolenticular tissue caused by excessive tissue-damaging copper accumulation and in which liver involvement most frequently presents in childhood. Neurological signs also accompany liver disease with time. However, subclinical neurological involvement may occur earlier and diagnostic methods that reveal this subclinical involvement are not well established. The aim of the current study is to assess the subclinical neurological involvement by using multimodality evoked potential (EP) measurements and to explore the relationship between neurological disease and the severity of liver damage.METHODS: The patient group included 28 children (mean age 11.8 ± 2.9 years, range 5.5-17) diagnosed with WD and a control group included 24 age-matched healthy children. Multimodality EP tests (Nihon Kohden Neuropack 8 4200K) of both groups were performed at the Department of Neurology Electrophysiology Laboratory of Ege University.RESULTS: At least one abnormal EP value was observed in 53.5% of the children in the patient group. At least on one side, there were abnormal values for visual evoked potential (VEP) P100, brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) and somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), where the ratios were 25, 28.5, and 11%, respectively. Absolute latency values of patients with right-side VEP P100 and left-side BAEP I, and the interpeak latency values of right-side BAEP I-III were significantly high. The difference in right-side BAEP I-III interpeak latency between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic groups was found to be statistically significant (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: The EP examinations can be an indicator of subclinical brain damage in non-neurological WD; however, cirrhosis because of WD does not cause an increase in the EP values. Detection of changes in the EP values periodically, especially at the time of diagnosis and during the treatment follow-up, may be valuable for revealing subclinical impairment.",

DSM-IV-TR diagnoses were established by an expert panel blinded to the self-reported rating scale data. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) of each scale.RESULTS: All scales performed better than chance (AUC 0.75-0.85). Sensitivity ranged from 0.66 to 0.85 and specificity ranged from 0.60 to 0.88. The UPDRS Depression item had a smaller AUC than the BDI-II, HAM-D-17, IDS-C, and MADRS. The CESD-R also had a smaller AUC than the MADRS. The remaining AUCs were statistically similar.CONCLUSIONS: The GDS-30 may be the most efficient depression screening scale to use in PD because of its brevity, favorable psychometric properties, and lack of copyright protection. However, all scales studied, except for the UPDRS Depression, are valid screening tools when PD-specific cutoff scores are used.",

Forty TTH patients, who were diagnosed with TTH were included, and 40 control group subjects were formed according to the same demographic data. SPSSv13 was used for Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficients was used for the determination of the relation between the groups and categorical.RESULTS: Mean age was 33.04 +/- 9.07 years. An average of RR2k latency was significantly high in migraine group comparing with TTH and the control groups, and in TTH group comparing with the control group. Similarly, the average of LR2k latency was found to be significantly higher in migraine group than TTH and the control groups, and significantly higher in TTH group than the control group.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that brainstem and trigeminovascular connections play an important role in migraine pathogenesis and that central mechanisms play a role in TTH and concerning these two diseases.",

The clinical study consisted of 56 patients with drug-resistant, complex partial seizures. Tracer for ictal SPECT was injected using automated injection in 27 patients and manual injection (MI) in the remaining 29. Injection time (T(I)) was measured in seconds from seizure onset to the end of volume injection. The SISCOM (Subtraction Ictal Spect Co-registered to MRI) procedure was used to locate the epileptogenic seizure focus with SPECT. The definition of seizure focus was made by consensus of the epilepsy unit using conventional diagnostic methods.RESULTS: During the experimental phase, there were no system failures, and the error in injected doses when using automated injection was lower than with MI. During the clinical phase, T(I) using manual injection was 41 s with a range of 14-103 s, compared with an AIS average of 33 s with a range of 19-63 s (P < 0.05). Ictal SPECT and SISCOM successfully localized the seizure focus in 21 of the 27 patients (78%) by AIS and in 19 of the 29 patients (65%) by MI (P = 0.14). Furthermore, nursing staff found the AIS method more convenient than the MI method.CONCLUSION: An AIS can improve the quality of work of the nursing staff in the neurology ward and allow a finer adjustment of the injection dose. Early results using an AIS would indicate a reduction in injection time and improved SPECT accuracy.",

We analyzed data on 359 patients (194 men and 165 women), diagnosed with CNS tumours according to the World Health Organization's diagnostic criteria, in period 1995-2010. The data were obtained from the Neurology and Neurosurgery Department, including other medical records. The data were analysed with t-test and chi-square test. A total of 359 cases of tumours in CNS were recorded for the period of 1995-2010, with slight predominance of men (194;54.0%) over women (165;46.0%). Under the assumption of gender equality, we did not detect a significant gender difference in tumour diagnosis (p = 0.279). Mean age at the diagnosis was 64.1 +/- 12.6 years, with significant gender difference: mean age at diagnosis for men was 62.8 +/- 11.6 years, while for women it was 65.7 +/- 13.5 (p = 0.029). The commonest type of all tumours was metastases (144;40.1%). When only primary tumours were analysed, the commonest type was glioblastoma (125;58.15%), followed by meningeoma (44;20.5%). The remaining types were much less frequent, with i.e. 5 recorded cases of the following three types: astrocytoma, ependimoma and oligodendroglyoma (2.3%). These results suggest a commonly encountered epidemiological profile in the region, with commonest metastases, and glioblastoma as the most common primary tumour. Due to difficulties related to patient gravitating hospitals admittance and overall small sample size for more detailed analyses, it remains for future studies to determine potential association of the Homeland war (1991-1995) and the occurrence of CNS tumours.",

Depressive symptoms were assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and the PD severity was assessed according to the Hoehn and Yahr System. Activities of daily living and motor symptoms were measured by the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), parts II and III.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients had a mild depression (HRSD total score ranging between 8 and 17), 30 had a moderate depression (HRSD total score ranging between 18 and 24), and 6 had a severe depression (HRSD total score, ?25). By comparing the 3 groups of patients, it emerged that those with a severe depression showed significantly higher scores at the UPDRS II, UPDRS III, and HY scales than did PD-C or patients with a mild depression. Moreover, patients with a moderate depression scored significantly higher on the UPDRS II, UPDRS III, and HY scales than did PD-C or those with a mild depression.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that depression and motor symptoms/well-being are highly intertwined in patients with PD.",

Patients were given the option to cross-over to the other treatment group at each visit. HR was performed during standard length neurology clinic appointments by a neurologist trained to perform hypnosis (Y.E.). Follow-up interviews were performed between 6 and 12 months following treatment initiation to evaluate patient compliance, changes in headache frequency or severity, and quality-of-life parameters.RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were enrolled, 92 agreed to receive prophylactic therapy of some kind. Fifty-three (57.6%) patients chose HR of which 36 (67.9%) actually initiated this treatment, while 39 (42.4%) chose pharmacological therapy with AMT of which 25 (64.1%) patients actually initiated therapy. Patients with greater analgesic use were more likely to opt for AMT (P= .0002). Eleven of the patients initially choosing AMT and 2 of the patients initially choosing HR crossed over to the other group. Seventy-four percent of the patients in the HR group and 58% of patients in the AMT group had a 50% reduction in the frequency of headaches (P= .16). Long-term adherence to treatment with HR exceeded that of AMT. At the end of the study period, 26 of 47 patients who tried HR compared with 10 of 27 who tried AMT continued receiving their initial treatment.CONCLUSIONS: HR treatment was a more popular choice among patients. Patients choosing HR reported greater symptom relief than those choosing AMT and were found to have greater treatment compliance. Patients receiving HR were less likely to change treatments. HR practiced by a neurologist is feasible in a standard neurological outpatient clinic setting; HR training should be considered for neurologists involved in headache treatment.",

Most studies have focused on inhaled metals, whereas less information is available for other particle types regarding the effects on the brain and other extra-pulmonary organs. We review here the key available literature on nanoparticle uptake and transport through the olfactory pathway, the experimental data from animal and in vitro studies, and human epidemiological observations. Nanoparticles (<0.1 ìm in one dimension) may easily reach the brain from the respiratory tract via sensory neurons and transport from the distal alveoli into the blood or lymph as free particles or inside phagocytic cells. These mechanisms and subsequent biologic responses may be influenced by the chemical composition of inhaled particles. Animal studies with ambient particulate matter and certain other particles show alterations in neuro-inflammatory markers of oxidative stress and central neurodegeneration. Human observations indicate motor, cognitive, and behavioral changes especially after particulate metal exposure in children. Exposure to co-pollutants and/or underlying disease states could also impact both the biokinetics and effects of airborne particles in the brain. Data are needed from the areas of inhalation, neurology, and metal toxicology in experimental and human studies after inhalation exposure. An increased understanding of the neurotoxicity associated with air pollution exposure is critical to protect susceptible individuals in the workplace and the general population.",

A neurology consult made the diagnosis of twitch-convulsive syndrome associated with uremic encephalopathy. While the patient was receiving the dexmedetomidine infusion, the signs of the twitch-convulsive syndrome, particularly the twitching and tremors, disappeared. Within 30 minutes of the end of the dexmedetomidine infusion, symptoms of the twitch-convulsive syndrome returned, manifesting as acute tremulousness. After several dialysis treatments, his BUN decreased and the dexmedetomidine was weaned, without return of the symptoms of twitch-convulsive syndrome.",

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension and its association with blood pressure (BP) levels, arterial stiffness, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders and medication in individuals aged 80 years and over living in nursing home.METHODS: In 994 individuals (77% women, mean age 88±5 years), the presence of orthostatic hypotension was tested according to American Autonomic Society and American Academy of Neurology guidelines. Arterial stiffness was evaluated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), peripheral to central pulse pressure amplification (PPA) and augmentation index. Cardiovascular and metabolic disorders as well as medications were recorded from patients' medical records.RESULTS: The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was 18%. Treated hypertensive patients with SBP 140 mmHg or less had a lower prevalence of orthostatic hypotension than patients with SBP more than 140 mmHg (respectively, 13 vs. 23%; P < 0.001). Individuals with orthostatic hypotension exhibited higher brachial and central PP than individuals without orthostatic hypotension (respectively, 69±18 vs. 65±16 mmHg and 57±17 vs. 54±15 mmHg; P < 0.01). In these same individuals, a significant increase in augmentation index (31.1±14.0 vs. 27.2±13.6%; P < 0.01), but not in cf-PWV or in PPA, was observed. Individuals with orthostatic hypotension were treated more frequently with â-blockers and less frequently with angiotensin receptor blockers or nitrates than individuals without orthostatic hypotension (P < 0.05 for both).CONCLUSION: Contrary to the general belief, elderly individuals with well controlled BP (SBP < 140 mmHg) show lower orthostatic hypotension, thus constituting a complementary argument for efficaciously treating hypertension in these individuals.",

Inherited or acquired prothrombotic states play a key role in the development of this disease, such as factor V G1691A mutation (FV Leiden). A 15-year-old girl presented to the Department of Neurology with a complaint of severe headache with visual blurring. The diagnosis of CVT was not initially suspected because of the patient's condition on presentation. An MRI showed thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus, confirming venous stroke. Anticardiolipin and antiphospholipid antibodies were assessed. In addition, inherited prothrombotic defects, such as protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiencies, and genetic mutations for FV Leiden, prothrombin gene G20210A (FII G20210A), and methyltetrahydrofolate reductase C677T (MTHFR C677T) were studied. All results were unremarkable except for the unique homozygous FV Leiden mutation, which likely contributed to this prothrombotic situation. This study highlights the fact that FV Leiden may play a significant role in the onset of CVT in young patients.",

This open-label prospective community-based clinical trial was designed to determine the time-to-onset and the magnitude of the beneficial effects of rasagiline in PD patients.METHODS: Patients received rasagiline of 1.0 mg once daily as monotherapy or 0.5 mg once daily as adjunct therapy (adjunct therapy dose could be increased to 1 mg/d if clinically indicated) for 12 weeks. Dietary restrictions and recommendations regarding concurrent antidepressant treatment consistent with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations were in keeping with typical usage. Effectiveness was measured as change from baseline in bradykinesia scores and physicians' and patients' global impression. Patients were prospectively monitored for treatment emergent dopaminergic side effects, tyramine reactions, and possible interactions with commonly used antidepressants.RESULTS: Objective and subjective measures of symptom severity improved at 1 week in 272 PD patients treated with once-daily rasagiline (n=123 monotherapy, n=149 adjunct therapy). The magnitude of beneficial effect was similar in monotherapy and adjunct therapy patients. No significant dopaminergic side effects, tyramine reactions, or interactions with antidepressants were observed in the 12-week trial.CONCLUSIONS: Rasagiline has a measurable beneficial effect on PD symptoms within 1 week of treatment. Rasagiline has a similar magnitude of benefit in monotherapy and adjunct therapy patients. Adverse interactions between antidepressants and rasagiline were not observed in patients in this trial. The usual use of rasagiline in community neurology practice, consistent with the FDA labeling, seems safe and effective.",

We aimed to determine if TBL was more effective than passive learning (PL) in improving knowledge outcomes in two key neurology topics - neurological localization and neurological emergencies.METHODS: We conducted a modified crossover study during a nine-week internal medicine posting involving 49 third-year medical undergraduates, using TBL as the active intervention, compared against self-reading as a PL control, for teaching the two topics. Primary outcome was the mean percentage change in test scores immediately after (post-test 1) and 48 hours after TBL (post-test 2), compared to a baseline pre-test. Student engagement was the secondary outcome.RESULTS: Mean percentage change in scores was greater in the TBL versus the PL group in post-test 1 (8.8% vs 4.3%, p = 0.023) and post-test 2 (11.4% vs 3.4%, p = 0.001). After adjustment for gender and second year examination grades, mean percentage change in scores remained greater in the TBL versus the PL group for post-test 1 (10.3% vs 5.8%, mean difference 4.5%,95% CI 0.7 - 8.3%, p = 0.021) and post-test 2 (13.0% vs 4.9%, mean difference 8.1%,95% CI 3.7 - 12.5%, p = 0.001), indicating further score improvement 48 hours post-TBL. Academically weaker students, identified by poorer examination grades, showed a greater increase in scores with TBL versus strong students (p < 0.02). Measures of engagement were high in the TBL group, suggesting that continued improvements in scores 48 hours post-TBL may result from self-directed learning.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to PL, TBL showed greater improvement in knowledge scores, with continued improvement up to 48 hours later. This effect is larger in academically weaker students. TBL is an effective method for improving knowledge in neurological localization and neurological emergencies in undergraduates.",

Ischemic stroke was confirmed by CT scan or autopsy in patients admitted to the 2nd Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland from 1995 to 2007. Male and female patients were compared for risk factors, state of activity prior to stroke, stroke type according to Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, diagnostic test findings, and early 30-day outcome. Data on 1379 women and 1155 men admitted with ischemic stroke were analyzed. The mean age of female and male patients was 74.3 and 68.8 years, respectively. Women were more often disabled prior to stroke, hypertensive, diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or heart failure, and had impaired consciousness at admission, whereas men were more likely to smoke, abuse alcohol and have a history of myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack. A higher percentage of female stroke patients suffered from total anterior circulation syndrome than males (21.2% and 14.0%, respectively). Internal carotid artery stenosis over 70% was reported in 10.8% ofwomen and 19.1% of men. The 30-day mortality and poor outcome rates were significantly higher in women than men (17.2% vs. 13.1% and 59.9% vs. 46.2%). After adjusting for casemix in multivariate analysis, female sex was independently associated with a higher risk of an early poor outcome. In conclusion, the risk factor distribution, clinical characteristics, diagnostic test findings, and early outcomes were different between female and male ischemic stroke patients. Female sex was associated with poorer prognosis, indicating that more intensive acute and long-term global care may be needed to improve the outcome among female stroke patients.",

The aim of this study was to document the clinical, electromyographic, and histological changes in dengue-associated muscle dysfunction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seropositive dengue patients admitted to the neurology ward during 2010 were enrolled in this study. Detailed medical history, including bleeding diathesis and organomegaly, were noted. Muscle power on a 0-5 scale, muscle tone, reflex, sensations and coordination were tested. Blood counts, hemoglobin, and serum chemistry, including creatine kinase (CK) evaluations, were carried out. Concentric needle electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy were performed when clinical conditions were suitable.RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 39 patients with dengue, with a median age of 28 years. Of these, 31 patients showed evidence of muscle involvement-16 with clinical and 15 with subclinical muscle involvement. Eight of these patients had severe weakness and five had hyporeflexia. Thrombocytopenia was present in 26 patients, elevated serum creatinine in three patients and liver dysfunction in 31 patients. The median CK level was 837 (range 194-3,832) U/L. The EMG revealed polyphasic normal to short duration motor unit potentials, but spontaneous activity was absent. Muscle biopsy in three patients revealed interstitial hemorrhage with occasional necrosis and myophagocytosis. There was no vasculitis, but subtle inflammatory changes were present in one patient. The severity of muscle weakness correlated with the platelet count and CK level. All patients improved by 15 days of treatment initiation.CONCLUSION: Dengue commonly results in benign and self-limiting transient muscle dysfunction.",

Cytokines have recently emerged as prime candidates underlying this immune reaction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMC) in AD.DESIGN: Cross-sectional (observational) study.SETTING: Behavioral and cognitive neurology clinic of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.PARTICIPANTS: AD patients (n=19), healthy elderly (n=19) and young (n=14) individuals.MEASUREMENTS: Cytokine levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) after exposing cells to a broad range of âAP concentrations (10(-4)-10(-10)M) as a stimulus. AD samples were weighed against leukocytes harvested from non-demented young and elderly subjects.RESULTS: Cytokine production of PBMCs in the youth was characterized by low baseline levels when compared to cells from the older generation. In the aging population, AD cells were distinguished from the healthy elderly sub-group by an even higher basal cytokine secretion. The low resting concentration in young individuals was markedly increased after treatment with âAP, however cells from the elderly, irrespective of their disease status, showed unchanged cytokine release following âAP administration. Non-specific activation of PBMCs with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies resulted in elevated interleukin (IL)-1â concentrations in AD.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a general over-production of cytokines and resistance to âAP in the old comparison group, with a more pronounced disruption/boosted pattern in AD. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis of \"inflammaging\", i.e. an enhanced inflammatory profile with normal aging and a further perturbed environment in AD. The observed cytokine profiles may serve as diagnostic biomarkers in dementia.",

Moreover, some studies concluded that increased MPV is related to poor functional outcome after ischaemic stroke, although this association is still controversial. However, the determinants of MPV in patients with acute ischaemic stroke have never been investigated.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recorded the main demographic, clinical and laboratory data of consecutive patients with acute (admitted within 24 h after stroke onset) ischaemic stroke admitted in our Neurology Service between January 2003 and December 2008. MPV was generated at admission by the Sysmex XE-2100 automated cell counter (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood samples stored at room temperature until measurement. The association of these parameters with MPV was investigated in univariate and multivariate analysis.RESULTS: A total of 636 patients was included in our study. The median MPV was 10.4 ± 0.82 fL. In univariate analysis, glucose (â= 0.03, P= 0.05), serum creatinine (â= 0.002, P= 0.02), haemoglobin (â= 0.009, P < 0.001), platelet count (â=-0.002, P < 0.001) and history of arterial hypertension (â= 0.21, P= 0.005) were found to be significantly associated with MPV. In multivariate robust regression analysis, only hypertension and platelet count remained as independent determinants of MPV.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute ischaemic stroke, platelet count and history of hypertension are the only determinants of MPV.",

The authors argues that Bo Sung Sim's introduction of cerebral hemispherectomy to Korea was not a simple application of an advanced medical technology, but a complicated and active process in that Sim used the technique to intervene intractable complications from cerebral paragonimiasis such as generalized convulsions, spastic hemiplegia and mental deterioration. Bo Sung Sim, one of the neurosurgeons of the first generation in Korea, was trained in neurology, neuropathology, neuroradiology and animal experiments as well as in neurosurgery at the University of Minnesota. After returning to Korea, Sim faced parasitic diseases, one of the most serious public health problems at that time, which were far different from what he learned in America. As a neurosurgeon, Sim tackled with parasitic diseases of the central nervous system with various diagnostics and therapeutics. In 1950s, more than one million populations suffered from pulmonary paragonimiasis acquired by eating raw crabs or by feeding juice of crushed crayfish for the treatment of measles in Korea. About 26.6 percent of people with paragonimiasis had cerebral paragonimiasis. Before bithionol therapy was introduced in 1962, neurosurgery was the only available treatment to control increased intracranial pressures, intractable epilepsy, paralysis and mental deterioration. Between 1958 to 1962, Bo Sung Sim operated on 24 patients of cerebral paragonimiasis. In two of them, he performed cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable convulsions when he found diffuse cerebral paragonimiasis and cerebral atrophy at the operating table. The two patients were recovered dramatically after the operation. The first patient became a part of medical campus for 20 years after hemispherectomy, doing chores at the hospital and helping Bo Sung Sim for his teaching neuroanatomy. The presence of the hemispherectomized patient in the classroom impressed the students deeply. Furthermore, the hemispherectomized patient stimulated Sim and his school to perform research upon the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the brain with hemispherectomized animals.",

Children with a normal baseline ultrasound report were included. Follow-up ultrasound reports after at least 1 year were collected. However, patients with any evidence of chronic illness or medications that may affect the kidney functions in addition to those who are not compliant with the prescribed dose were excluded. Family history of renal stones, symptoms suggestive of urologic disorders, and comorbidities were recorded.KEY FINDINGS: Medical charts of 96 children on TPM with a mean age of 6.9 (±3.8) years were reviewed; 52 (54.2%) of the children were male. The follow-up ultrasound showed that five children (5.2%) had developed kidney stones. The occurrence of kidney stones was found in four female patients (80%) versus one male (20%) (p > 0.05).SIGNIFICANCE: Long-term use of TPM may result in increased incidence of asymptomatic kidney stones in the pediatric population. Hence, routine baseline and follow-up ultrasound of the urinary system should be recommended during the use of TPM in children.",

Informant report was also systematically obtained.RESULTS: A high rate of Questionnaire positivity was found (35.0% by combined patient and informant report; 24.6% by patient report alone; 27.4% by informant report alone), despite usage of relatively low dosages of dopaminergic medications (mean/median total l-dopa equivalent units of 528/450 mg/day; mean/median agonist-only l-dopa equivalent units of 74/37 mg/day). Eating, sexual and punding or hobbyism behaviors were relatively common, while gambling and compulsive medication use occurred less frequently. Agreement between patient- and informant-reporting of impulsive-compulsive behaviors was moderate-to-fair (Kappa values ranging from 0.203 to 0.494). Factors associated with Questionnaire positivity on univariate analysis were male gender, younger age at Parkinson's disease onset, longer disease duration, use of dopamine agonist or amantadine therapy, higher total l-dopa equivalent units and higher dopamine agonist-only l-dopa equivalent units. On multivariate analysis, male gender and longer disease duration independently predicted Questionnaire positivity. No association was found with cognitive or apathy scores.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Asian patients with Parkinson's disease may be susceptible to dopaminergic medication-related side effects. The data here also contribute to the understanding of the psychometric properties of the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders.",

We examined changes in residents' experience during the past decade.METHODS: A 12-item survey was sent to US neurology residents in their final year of training. Items examined residents' experience and confidence with assessment of the acute stroke patient and use of tPA for treatment. Questions were worded identically in the 2000 and 2010 surveys, and responses were compared between the two.RESULTS: Of 491 residents, 286 (58%) responded. There was a significant increase from 2000 to 2010 in the percentage of residents who felt comfortable independently treating with tPA (73% versus 94%, P<0.001), who had observed administration of tPA (88% versus 99%, P<0.001), who had personally treated with tPA (80% versus 95%, P<0.001), and who had been involved in post-tPA care (89% versus 98%, P<0.001). There was a substantial increase in residents with formal training in using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (65% versus 92%, P<0.001) and who had dedicated stroke teams at their institution (84% versus 93%, P=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Neurology residents' experience and comfort treating acute ischemic stroke with tPA increased significantly between 2000 and 2010, as did resident exposure to stroke teams and formal training in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.",

In patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and related disorders, the process of transition is complicated by the presence of intellectual handicap, treatment-resistant epilepsy, and behavioral issues. Patients who are not successfully transitioned to adult care may end up without specialty care, may not receive satisfactory adult services, may lack adequate follow-up and access to newer therapies, and may lack appropriate management of comorbid conditions. Several family related and clinician-related barriers can inhibit the transition process. Transition strategies that maximize each patient's ability to achieve his or her potential and optimize self-sufficiency may lead to better social outcomes. Adolescent clinics that include members of the pediatric and adult neurology teams may help ensure a smooth transition to adult care, although studies are needed to objectively establish the best model. Results are reported from a survey of 133 symposium attendees on the topic of practice characteristics and issues related to transitioning care. Results suggested a great deal of dissatisfaction about the process of transition, especially for patients with intellectual handicap. We provide suggestions for developing a transition program, including identifying a willing adult service, adapting a multidisciplinary approach, addressing legal and psychosocial issues, and celebrating rites of passage.",

Patients with MRI confirmed acute lacunar infarcts without pre-existing dementia were recruited. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for developing PSCI.RESULTS: 145 patients with a mean age of 55.8 years were studied of which 48 patients (33.1%) were identified to have PSCI. Patients with PSCI performed worse on the MMSE, MOCA and FAB and had significantly greater white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in the frontal subcortical (FSC) region (p = 0.006) and higher frontal subcortical acute infarct load (p = 0.002). Logistic regression demonstrated that deep subcortical WMH (odds ratio, OR = 1.45) and acute FSC infarcts (OR = 1.51) were associated with PSCI. High WMH load without acute FSC infarcts was associated with increased risk of PSCI (OR = 4.1). When patients developed acute FSC infarcts on pre-existing severe WMH, the risk of PSCI increased substantially (OR = 11.0).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute lacunar infarcts in the FSC region have 1.5 times risk of PSCI. This risk increases substantially to 11 times when there is pre-existing severe white matter disease.",

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be an effective treatment, but there are major obstacles to its provision in practice. We tested the hypothesis that adding CBT-based guided self-help (GSH) to the usual care (UC) received by patients improves outcomes.METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial in 2 neurology services in the United Kingdom. Outpatients with functional symptoms (rated by the neurologist as \"not at all\" or only \"somewhat\" explained by organic disease) were randomly allocated to UC or UC plus GSH. GSH comprised a self-help manual and 4 half-hour guidance sessions. The primary outcome was self-rated health on a 5-point clinical global improvement scale (CGI) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were measured at 3 and 6 months.RESULTS: In this trial, 127 participants were enrolled, and primary outcome data were collected for 125. Participants allocated to GSH reported greater improvement on the primary outcome (adjusted common odds ratio on the CGI 2.36 [95% confidence interval 1.17-4.74; p = 0.016]). The absolute difference in proportion \"better\" or \"much better\" was 13% (number needed to treat was 8). At 6 months the treatment effect was no longer statistically significant on the CGI but was apparent in symptom improvement and in physical functioning.CONCLUSIONS: CBT-based GSH is feasible to implement and efficacious. Further evaluation is indicated.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that CBT-based GSH therapy improves self-reported general health, as measured by the CGI, in patients with functional neurologic symptoms.",

All the patients had a magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of polymicrogyria, and most of the patients still have periodic checks, thus their outcome is known.RESULTS: The large majority were male (76.5%). The median age at presentation was 10 months; the reason for the study was psychomotor or mental delay (44%) followed by seizures (38.2%). During the condition patients presented with epilepsy (61.7%), infantile cerebral palsy (47%), psychomotor/mental retardation (94.1%), pervasive developmental disorder (26.4%), behavioural disturbances (38.2%), neurosensory deficit (35.2%) and microcephaly 67.6%. In 82.3% of patients there was bilateral involvement (42.8% perisylvian). Other abnormalities were observed in the MRI of 58.8% of patients. The electroencephalogram at diagnosis showed changes in 41.1%, and this rose to 67.6% during follow-up. 61.7% received antiepileptic treatment was received by 61.7% of patients, with 52.3% requiring ?2 drugs. Epilepsy surgery was performed on two patients. Some type of sequelae was observed in 91.1% of patients. The aetiology was unknown in 61.7%; a congenital infection was suspected in 10 patients and syndromic or polymalformative disorder in three patients.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the range of clinical and radiological expression in polymicrogyria, in addition to the possibilities for the future in terms of determining the aetiology of this pathology.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted consecutively from March to May 2010 for headache among general neurological outpatients attending the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Personal interviews were carried out and a questionnaire was used to collect medical records. Diagnosis of headache was according to the International classification of headache disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD-II). Headache patients accounted for 19.5% of the general neurology clinic outpatients. A total of 843 (50.1%) patients were defined as having primary headache, 454 (27%) secondary headache, and 386 (23%) headache not otherwise specified (headache NOS). For primary headache, 401 (23.8%) had migraine, 399 (23.7%) tension-type headache (TTH), 8 (0.5%) cluster headache and 35 (2.1%) other headache types. Overall, migraine patients suffered (1) more severe headache intensity, (2) longer than 6 years of headache history and (3) more common analgesic medications use than TTH ones (p < 0.001).TTH patients had more frequent episodes of headaches than migraine patients, and typically headache frequency exceeded 15 days/month (p < 0.001); 22.8% of primary headache patients were defined as chronic daily headache. Almost 20% of outpatient visits to the general neurology department were of headache patients, predominantly primary headache of migraine and TTH. In outpatient headaches, more attention should be given to headache intensity and duration of headache history for migraine patients, while more attention to headache frequency should be given for the TTH ones.",

      "abstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Perioperative nerve injuries are devastating complications that are commonly attributed to a variety of patient, surgical, or anesthetic factors. Well-documented causes of postsurgical neuropathy include nerve compression, stretch, contusion, or transection, which can occur following surgical trauma or patient positioning. Potential anesthetic causes of perioperative nerve injury include mechanical trauma, local anesthetic toxicity, and ischemic injury. We present a case of a diffuse, bilateral neurologic deficit of unclear etiology in a patient who underwent a combined neuraxial-general anesthetic for bilateral total hip arthroplasty.CASE REPORT: A 17-year old boy with end-stage Legg-Perthes disease presented with severe lower-extremity neuropathy of both legs following bilateral total hip arthroplasty under combined epidural-general anesthesia. A thorough workup excluded potentially devastating and treatable causes, including epidural hematoma or abscess and surgical bleeding or trauma. A neurology consultation and further testing (electromyography, nerve biopsy) resulted in a diagnosis of postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy. Treatment with prolonged, high-dose corticosteroids was undertaken, and although the patient's symptoms improved, he continues to have significant neurologic deficits 8 months after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative nerve deficits not readily explained by direct surgical or anesthesia-related causes should prompt early neurologic consultation to seek alternative etiologies such as postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy. Although this condition is poorly understood, it is believed to be an idiopathic immune-mediated response to a physiologic stress (eg, surgery, regional block) and is treated with prolonged, high-dose corticosteroids. Because suppression of the immune system with high-dose steroids may result in improved neurologic outcome, it is essential that surgeons and anesthesiologists are aware of this condition so that treatment is not delayed.",

Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed to minimize the risk of further metabolic decompensations and to improve the quality of life. We performed a retrospective review of all children with PA who underwent LT between 1987 and 2008. Five children were identified with a median age of 1.2 years (range = 0.7-4.1 years) at referral. Four of the children presented clinically at 3 weeks of age or less, and 1 child was diagnosed prenatally. All had metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia. Two had seizures and required intensive care; this care included inotropic support and continuous venovenous hemofiltration in 1 child. The children were considered for elective LT for the following reasons: frequent metabolic decompensations (2), previous sibling death (2), and elective management (1). One child underwent auxiliary LT, and 4 children received orthotopic grafts (1 living related graft). The median age at LT was 1.5 years (range = 0.8-7.0 years). There was 1 retransplant 3 months after LT due to hepatic artery thrombosis. One year after LT, 1 patient suffered a metabolic stroke with minimal residual neurology. After a median follow-up of 7.3 years (range = 2.2-15.0 years), all the children had normal graft function and a good quality of life with a protein-unrestricted diet and no further metabolic decompensations. In conclusion, LT has a role in the management of PA: it reduces the risk of metabolic decompensation and improves the quality of life. The potential for the development of metabolic sequelae is not completely eliminated.",

We report a case of juvenile cerebrovascular disease presenting retinal vessel abnormalities, which clinically resembled cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with stroke and ischemic leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) but in which Notch3 gene mutations were not detected.CASE: A 42-year old woman was hospitalized at the department of Neurology in our hospital, complaining of headache and dysarthria. MRI showed bilateral spotted white matter lesions in the paraventricular area and the temporal lobe, and an ovoid lesion in the right corona radiata. Despite steroid pulse therapy, she developed right incomplete hemiparesis and new lesions were detected in the anterior temporal pole and external capsule. Her genetic analysis showed no mutations in the Notch 3 gene. Ophthalmological examination revealed arterial sheathing in the peripapillary region. Fluorescein angiography showed narrowing of the retinal arterioles and distinguished a peripheral vascular network.CONCLUSION: In this case, ophthalmological examination revealed retinal vessel abnormalities in a relatively young woman with no risk factors such as hypertention or artheriosclerosis, presenting recurrent subcortical strokes. This actual case indicates the association between retinal vessel abnormalities and cerebral SVDs.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of rituximab in several standard-of-care-refractory autoimmune diseases (within rheumatology, nephrology, dermatology and neurology) other than rheumatoid arthritis or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a real-life clinical setting.METHODS: Patients who received rituximab having shown an inadequate response to standard-of-care had their safety and clinical outcomes data retrospectively analysed as part of the German Registry of Autoimmune Diseases. The main outcome measures were safety and clinical response, as judged at the discretion of the investigators.RESULTS: A total of 370 patients (299 patient-years) with various autoimmune diseases (23.0% with systemic lupus erythematosus, 15.7% antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated granulomatous vasculitides, 15.1% multiple sclerosis and 10.0% pemphigus) from 42 centres received a mean dose of 2,440 mg of rituximab over a median (range) of 194 (180 to 1,407) days. The overall rate of serious infections was 5.3 per 100 patient-years during rituximab therapy. Opportunistic infections were infrequent across the whole study population, and mostly occurred in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. There were 11 deaths (3.0% of patients) after rituximab treatment (mean 11.6 months after first infusion, range 0.8 to 31.3 months), with most of the deaths caused by infections. Overall (n = 293), 13.3% of patients showed no response, 45.1% showed a partial response and 41.6% showed a complete response. Responses were also reflected by reduced use of glucocorticoids and various immunosuppressives during rituximab therapy and follow-up compared with before rituximab. Rituximab generally had a positive effect on patient well-being (physician's visual analogue scale; mean improvement from baseline of 12.1 mm).CONCLUSIONS: Data from this registry indicate that rituximab is a commonly employed, well-tolerated therapy with potential beneficial effects in standard of care-refractory autoimmune diseases, and support the results from other open-label, uncontrolled studies.",

An ADEM-like first demyelinating event can be the first attack of pediatric MS, but international consensus definitions require two or more non-ADEM demyelinating events for diagnosis of MS. In our patient KIDMUS MRI criteria for MS (Mikaeloff et al. J Pediatr 144:246-252, 2004a; Mikaeloff et al. Brain 127:1942-1947, 2004b) were negative at first attack, but Barkhof criteria for lesion dissemination in space in adults (Barkhof et al. 120:2059-2069, 1997), Callen modified MS-criteria and Callen MS-ADEM criteria for children (Callen et al. Neurology 72:961-967, 2009a; Callen et al. Neurology 72:968-973, 2009b) were positive suggesting pediatric MS. As the clinical course was devastating with non-responsiveness upon high-dose immune modulatory therapy and due to the absence of an alternative diagnosis other than demyelinating disease brain biopsy was performed. Brain biopsy studies or autopsy case reports of fulminant pediatric MS patients are extremely rare. Histopathology revealed an inflammatory demyelinating CNS process with confluent demyelination, indicating the likelihood of a relapsing disease course compatible with an acute to subacute demyelinating inflammatory disease. This pattern was corresponding to the early active multiple sclerosis subtype I of Lucchinetti et al. (Ann Neurol 47(6):707-717, 2000).",

Head injuries experienced by battered children are the main cause of deaths and neurological complications. A special form of damage inflicted in battered children is vessel background brain injury. The objective of the article was to characterize central nervous system injuries and their results in children who were victims of physical violence. Medical records of three patients hospitalized in Department of Neurology of the Polish Mother Health Center Institute in Lodz, in whom the battered child syndrome had been diagnosed, were analyzed. The authors discussed three cases of children with central nervous system injuries caused by physical violence. All the children were treated pharmacologically, placed on parenteral nutrition and rehabilitated. Among typical central nervous system injuries caused by head trauma, particular attention of the authors was focused on hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, a complication of a still unclear etiology that occurred in two cases. Battered children are usually treated in surgical departments and the causes of injuries are not always correctly diagnosed. Brain damage is the reason for permanent neurological consequences in children who experienced physical violence. In medico-legal practice, it is essential to describe precisely all the visible injuries (bruises, abrasions, wounds) especially during the initial medical examination.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A), the most common form of CMT2, is caused by mutations in the mitofusin 2 gene (MFN2), a nuclear encoded gene essential for mitochondrial fusion and tethering the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. Published CMT2A phenotypes have differed widely in severity.METHODS: To determine the prevalence and phenotypes of CMT2A within our clinics we performed genetic testing on 99 patients with CMT2 evaluated at Wayne State University in Detroit and on 27 patients with CMT2 evaluated in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. We then preformed a cross-sectional analysis on our patients with CMT2A.RESULTS: Twenty-one percent of patients had MFN2 mutations. Most of 27 patients evaluated with CMT2A had an earlier onset and more severe impairment than patients without CMT2A. CMT2A accounted for 91% of all our severely impaired patients with CMT2 but only 11% of mildly or moderately impaired patients. Twenty-three of 27 patients with CMT2A were nonambulatory prior to age 20 whereas just one of 78 non-CMT2A patients was nonambulatory after this age. Eleven patients with CMT2A had a pure motor neuropathy while another 5 also had profound proprioception loss. MFN2 mutations were in the GTPase domain, the coiled-coil domains, or the highly conserved R3 domain of the protein.CONCLUSIONS: We find MFN2 mutations particularly likely to cause severe neuropathy that may be primarily motor or motor accompanied by prominent proprioception loss. Disruption of functional domains of the protein was particularly likely to cause neuropathy.",

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, spontaneous perfusion restored, and therapeutic hypothermia was attempted for neural protection. After rewarming to 36.5°C, neurologic examination showed no eye opening or response to pain, spontaneous myoclonic movements, sluggishly reactive pupils, absent corneal reflexes, and intact gag and spontaneous respirations. Over 24 hrs, remaining cranial nerve function was lost. The neurologic examination was consistent with brain death. Apnea test and repeat clinical examination after a duration of 6 hrs confirmed brain death. Death was pronounced and the family consented to organ donation. Twenty-four hrs after brain death pronouncement, on arrival to the operating room for organ procurement, the patient was found to have regained corneal reflexes, cough reflex, and spontaneous respirations. The care team faced the challenge of offering an adequate explanation to the patient's family and other healthcare professionals involved.INTERVENTIONS: Induced hypothermia and brain death determination.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: This represents the first published report in an adult patient of reversal of a diagnosis of brain death made in full adherence to American Academy of Neurology guidelines. Although the reversal was transient and did not impact the patient's prognosis, it impacted his eligibility for organ donation and cast doubt about the ability to determine irreversibility of brain death findings in patients treated with hypothermia after cardiac arrest.CONCLUSIONS: We strongly recommend caution in the determination of brain death after cardiac arrest when induced hypothermia is used. Confirmatory testing should be considered and a minimum observation period after rewarming before brain death testing ensues should be established.",

      "abstractText": "Patients with chronic medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) can be impaired in different tasks that evaluate emotional or social abilities. In particular, the recognition of facial emotions can be affected (Meletti S, Benuzzi F, Rubboli G, et al. Neurology 2003;60:426-31. Meletti S, Benuzzi F, Cantalupo G, Rubboli G, Tassinari CA, Nichelli P. Epilepsia 2009;50:1547-59). To better understand the nature of emotion recognition deficits in MTLE we investigated the decoding of basic emotions in the visual (facial expression) and auditory (emotional prosody) domains in 41 patients. Results showed deficits in the recognition of both facial and vocal expression of emotions, with a strong correlation between performances across the two tasks. No correlation between emotion recognition and measures of IQ, quality of life (QOLIE-31), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory) was significant, except for a weak correlation between prosody recognition and IQ. These data suggest that emotion recognition impairment in MTLE is not dependent on the sensory channel through which the emotional stimulus is transmitted. Moreover, these findings support the notion that emotional processing is at least partly independent of measures of cognitive intelligence.",

Demographic, risk factors, clinical, neuroimaging and outcome variables were analyzed and compared with patients with first-ever cerebral infarction (n=2.099) to identify predictors of ischemic recurrent stroke. Significant variables were entered into a multivariate logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Ischemic recurrent strokes accounted for 22.4% of all acute consecutive ischemic strokes. Frequency of ischemic stroke recurrence were significantly different among ischemic stroke subtypes: 26.2% in atherothrombotic, 24.4% in cardioembolic, 21.8% in lacunar stroke, 15.8% in infarcts of unusual etiology and 12% infarctions of uncertain etiology. The overall in-hospital mortality and symptom free at discharge in recurrent vs. non-recurrent stroke patients rate was 16.2 vs. 12% (p=0.005) and 17.8 vs. 27.3% (p=0.0001) respectively. Previous intracerebral hemorrhage (OR=3.07; 95% CI, 1.51-6.25), intermittent claudication (OR=1.39; 95% CI, 1.01-1.90), arterial hypertension (OR=1.32; 95% CI, 1.09-1.59), diabetes mellitus (OR=1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.56), age (OR=1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03), female gender (OR=0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.77), headache (OR=0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.87) and bulbar topography (OR=0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.89) were independent clinical variables related to ischemic stroke recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: About one in every four patients with ischemic stroke had an ischemic stroke recurrence. In-hospital mortality is 16.2% and clinical profiles were different in ischemic stroke recurrence when compared to first-ever ischemic stroke patients.",

She had taken no medicine. Except for the ITP, she had no history of systemic disease. She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunosuppressions consisting of high-dose steroid were started. When preparing the patient for discharge, a generalized myoclonic seizure occurred at the 47th day of admission. At that time, the laboratory and neurology studies showed hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. Brain MRI and EEG showed brain atrophy without other lesion. The seizure stopped after the blood sugar and serum osmolarity declined below the upper normal limit. The patient became asymptomatic and she was discharged 10 weeks after admission under maintenance therapy with prednisolone, insulin glargine and nateglinide. The patient remained asymptomatic under maintenance therapy with deflazacort and without insulin or medication for blood sugar control.",

The incidence of significant intracranial neurology after unilateral vertebral damage is extremely rare, and to our knowledge, no such injury has been sustained while playing sport.PURPOSE: To describe a rare vascular complication of a bifacet C5-C6 dislocation.STUDY DESIGN: Case report and clinical discussion.METHODS: We present a 28-year old white man who was a professional rugby player. He sustained a hyperflexion injury while playing scrum half in a recent league match, which resulted in a C5-C6 dislocation, diagnosed clinically and with a plain radiograph. The patient on admission had complete neurologic loss below C6.RESULTS: The patient underwent immediate computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that revealed a 50% displacement of C5 on C6 with a complete unifacet dislocation and the other facet partially dislocated. The MRI revealed signal changes in the cord at the C5-C6 level and an intimal tear in the left vertebral artery. The decision was taken to reduce the dislocation when medically stable. A few hours after injury, after an episode of vomiting, the patient sustained a respiratory arrest owing to the embolization of a clot from the left vertebral artery into the basilar artery. Despite rapid embolectomy and subsequent permanent left vertebral artery occlusion, the patient sustained multiple infarcts in the cerebellar, thalamic, occipital, and pontine regions of the brain that eventually proved fatal.CONCLUSION: This case shows a rare complication of unilateral vertebral artery occlusion. Despite early identification of a basilar infarct and a successful embolectomy, intracranial infarction occurred. Although there is no guideline for the treatment of vertebral artery damage, early reduction and anticoagulation may reduce the risk of cerebral infarction.",

These fatalities were supposed to have been induced by obsolete psychotropic drugs and were associated with Ivan Pavlov's hypnotherapy. The incidents were investigated both by highest administrative bodies and the General State Prosecutor of the former GDR. Archival sources suggest that lower party organs and the ministerial administration tried to make use of the proceedings to bring about the downfall of the head of the Leipzig Department, who had become ideologically suspicious. However, the official General State Prosecutor's investigation ascertained that both M?ller-Hegemann and Christa Kohler, head of the psychotherapeutic ward, were not to be held responsible. Although the SED Central Committee at first tried to influence the outcome on the basis of ideological reservations made by the university party organisation, it finally accepted and confirmed the judgment of the General State Prosecutor. Hence, in this case, the highest party bodies followed arguments that were the result of an independent investigation and were not influenced by an individual bias or ideological motives.",

Thus, FM patients seek care from multiple physician specialties. This study compared prescribing patterns, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), healthcare resource use (HRU), and direct costs related to FM in routine clinical practice across physician specialties.METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study recruited 203 FM subjects from 20 community-based physician offices (eight primary care, six rheumatology, three neurology, three psychiatry). Subjects completed questions about pain, other symptoms, quality of life, productivity, treatment effectiveness and satisfaction, and out-of-pocket expenses related to FM; site staff recorded subjects' treatment and HRU based on medical chart review. Results were compared across specialties. Statistical significance was evaluated at the 0.05 level. Annual direct costs associated with FM were calculated in 2009 US dollars.RESULTS: Subject demographic and clinical characteristics were not significantly different across physician specialties, except psychiatry subjects had the highest mean number of co-morbid conditions; p < 0.001. PROs were similar across physician specialties except fatigue; neurology subjects reported the highest levels. There were no significant differences in subject-reported outcomes of medication effectiveness (p = 0.782) and medication satisfaction (p = 0.338) for FM. Psychiatry subjects had more FM-related physician visits compared to other specialties (p = 0.013) and a higher proportion received diagnostic tests related to FM (p = 0.013). The mean (SD) number of FM prescription medications prescribed per subject was highest in the primary care and lowest in the neurology group; p = 0.024. The proportion of hypnotic (p = 0.001), muscle relaxant (p = 0.005), anxiolytic (p = 0.005), anti-epileptic (p = 0.007), and other medications (p = 0.044) prescribed for FM were significantly different across specialties. Overall direct medical costs did not differ significantly (p = 0.284) across specialties.CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics were similar across specialties, except with regards to comorbidity burden. This study noted significant differences among physician specialties in HRU and treatment patterns among medications, diagnostics, and outpatient visits. Consistent with other studies, this study did not identify a dominant strategy for FM management across physician specialties as overall per patient medical costs and subject-reported treatment satisfaction were similar. Future research to better characterize differences among physician specialties in FM management, as well as the reasons for these differences, would be useful.",

We identified 51 patients with acute encephalopathy with seasonal flu from the data base accumulated by Tokai Pediatric Neurology Society. We also collected 10 patients with acute encephalopathy with 2009 pandemic flu. The clinical course, laboratory data, neuroimaging findings, treatment, and the outcome of these patients were recruited using a structured research form. These data were compared between the two groups. The age was larger in the 2009 pandemic flu group (median, 109.5months) than in the seasonal flu group (median, 44months). There was no significant difference in other demographic data, neurologic symptoms, laboratory and neuroimaging findings, and treatment. Various degrees of neurologic sequelae including death were observed in 32% of the patients in the seasonal flu group, and in 50% in the 2009 pandemic flu groups. The analyses of patients with ages of 6years or older revealed that moderate or more severe sequelae were more frequent in patients with 2009 pandemic flu. Acute encephalopathy with 2009 pandemic flu occurred mainly among children with 6years of age or older, and the outcome was worse in this age group compared with acute encephalopathy with seasonal flu.",

Our objective was to compare HT use in midlife with that in late life on risk of dementia among 5,504 postmenopausal female members of an integrated healthcare delivery system.METHODS: HT use was determined at midlife (mean age, 48.7 years) from a survey in 1964 and in late life (mean age, 76 years) using pharmacy databases from 1994 to 1998. Risk of dementia diagnosis was evaluated with inpatient and outpatient diagnoses made in Neurology, Neuropsychology, and Internal Medicine from 1999 to 2008. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine effects of HT use at different times on dementia risk with adjustment for age, education, race, body mass index, number of children, and comorbidities.RESULTS: A total of 1,524 women (27%) were diagnosed with dementia during the follow-up period. Compared to women never on HT, those taking HT only at midlife had a 26% decreased risk (multivariate adjusted hazards ratio [aHR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.94 ), whereas those taking HT only in late life had a 48% increased risk (aHR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10-1.98), and women taking HT at both mid and late life had a similar risk of dementia (aHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78-1.34 ).INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that use of HT in midlife only may protect against cognitive impairment, whereas HT initiation in late life could have deleterious effects.",

In response, primarily based on expert consensus, medical schools have supplemented their curricula with standardized patient (SP) sessions that are focused on the neurologic examination. Hypothesis-driven quantitative data are needed to justify the further use of this resource-intensive educational modality, specifically regarding whether using SPs to teach the neurological examination effects a long-term benefit on the application of neurological examination skills.METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of prospectively collected data from medical students at Weill Cornell Medical College. The control group (n=129) received the standard curriculum. The intervention group (n=58) received the standard curriculum and an additional SP session focused on the neurologic examination during the second year of medical school. Student performance on the neurologic examination was assessed in the control and intervention groups via an OSCE administered during the fourth year of medical school. A Neurologic Physical Exam (NPE) score of 0.0 to 6.0 was calculated for each student based on a neurologic examination checklist completed by the SPs during the OSCE. Composite NPE scores in the control and intervention groups were compared with the unpaired t-test.RESULTS: In the fourth year OSCE, composite NPE scores in the intervention group (3.5±1.1) were statistically significantly greater than those in the control group (2.2±1.1) (p<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: SP sessions are an effective tool for teaching the neurologic examination. We determined that a single, structured SP session conducted as an adjunct to our traditional lectures and small groups is associated with a statistically significant improvement in student performance measured 2 years after the session.",

      "abstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and symmetric proximal muscle weakness, is the most common autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease in infants and children. In Caucasian population, about 95% of clinically typical patients lack both copies of the telomeric survival motor neuron gene (SMN 1). However, the detection rate of the homozygous absence in Chinese patients is still controversial, which may lead to reduced confidence in the SMA genetic testing in clinical practice. The purpose of the current study was to determine the frequency of homozygous deletions of SMN 1 in Chinese patients, to evaluate the significance of the SMN 1 homozygous deletion assay in clinical applications, and the impact of the clinical re-visit followed by the genetic testing.METHODS: Totally 85 patients initially suspected of SMA were referred for SMA genetic testing. A polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was used to detect the homozygous absence of SMN 1. Clinical re-visit was performed by the pediatric neurology specialists according to the international SMA diagnostic criteria, and histological examinations were carried out when they were necessary.RESULTS: Absence of both copies of SMN 1 exon 7 were found in 57 (67%) of the 85 patients, and 28 patients (33%) had at least one copy. For the 28 patients with negative results, 19 were followed up by the pediatric neurologists. The clinical diagnosis of SMA could be excluded in 15 patients, but retained in the other 4 patients after the clinical re-evaluation and histological examinations. Thus, approximately 95% of the patients with clinically typical SMA in our cohort lacked both copies of SMN 1. Homozygous deletions of SMN 1 were detected in 96% (22/23), 93% (28/30) and 100% (7/7) of the patients with SMA type I, type II and type III, respectively. There was no significant difference in the deletion frequency among the subtypes.CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of homozygous deletions of SMN 1 in this series of Chinese SMA patients was about 95%, which is similar to that reported in Caucasian population. The genetic test of homozygous deletions of SMN 1 should be considered as the first line test for the Chinese patients suspected of SMA. The clinical re-visit and re-evaluation which is essential in clinical diagnosis, genetic counseling and medical management, should be routinely performed after the genetic testing.",

Cognitive status was evaluated with the MMSE scoring system. Oral parameters, such as decaying, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) index and teeth present (PT) were evaluated in the patients. Oral hygiene status, denture status and mucosal lesions, including denture-induced stomatitis were also investigated.RESULTS: The study was conducted on the study group (31 AD patients) and the control group (47 healthy volunteers). Tooth brushing and denture cleaning were irregular in 22 of 31 (70%) patients with AD. The ratio of the subjects who forgot to remove their denture during the night was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (p < 0.001). In this study, decreased cognitive functions in AD patients have been demonstrated to result in a deterioration of denture care and increased denture-related mucosal lesions.CONCLUSIONS: These findings were considered due to decreased denture care including the non-removal of the denture in the night in the patients with decreased cognitive functions.",

This study evaluates the clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and laboratory parameters and imaging findings of optochiasmatic arachnoiditis (OCA) and also tried to identify any factors which can predict this complication in patients with TBM. Patients admitted with TBM in the neurology wards of a tertiary care teaching hospital over a period of 6 years formed the material for this study. Student's \"t\" test and univariate analysis were done to identify any predictors for this complication and the variables found to be significant were further analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. One hundred sixty-three patients with TBM, admitted over a 6-year period, were studied. Twenty-three (14%) patients developed OCA. Eighteen out of 23 (78%) developed this complication while on antituberculous treatment (ATT) and 5/23 (22%) were newly diagnosed cases of TBM. Of those already on treatment, 12/23 (52%) were receiving only ATT, the remaining 6/23 (26%) had received steroids along with ATT in varying doses and duration. The average period from diagnosis of TBM to visual symptoms was 6.4 months. On the multivariate logistic regression analysis, female sex (P < 0.037), age less than 27 (P < 0.008) years and protein content in the CSF > 260 mg% (P < 0.021) were the factors predisposing toward this complication. At 6 months follow-up, on treatment with steroids and ATT, 17% had improvement and no further deterioration was noted in visual acuity in 52%. OCA can develop even while on treatment with ATT. Young women with a high CSF protein content seem to be more prone for this complication.",

In this study we considered consciousness level as an easily measurable predictor and compared it to haemorrhage location, intraventricular penetration and haemorrhage size derived from Computerized Tomography (CT) to predict mortality using a parametric survival analysis model. Two hundred and thirty eight ICH patients from a neurology hospital ward were enrolled into this comparative study. Patient history was documented with respect to mortality and a questionnaire outlining background variables and medical history was completed for them. Consciousness level was clinically evaluated by a physician while haemorrhage size and location were determined via computerized tomographic scanning reports. Data were entered into the computer and analyzed according to the Weibull parametric survival analysis model using STATA 8 statistical software. Males constituted 47.1% of the 238 patients, 52.9% were females. The age range of the patients varied from 13 to 88 years, with a mean age of 62.4 +/- 13.6 (Mean +/- SD). Half of the patients survived more than 20 days. Using the Weibull regression model, the only significant independent symptomatological predictor of mortality was found to be the level of consciousness. Cumulative hazard during the 90 days was compared for different levels of consciousness. Application of Weibull to pathological predictors of ICH mortality showed that the two independent predictors were haemorrhage size and intraventricular penetration. Results of statistical modelling didn't provide evidence of priority for pathological predictors of survival compared to easily measurable levels of consciousness as a symptomatological predictor. Easily measurable symptoms of level of consciousness can be used as a survival predictor of stroke due to intra-cerebral haemorrhage when compared to pathological indicators.",

As the designation of UCH remains problematic, the underlying etiopathogenesis also lacks explanation. We investigated the patients admitted to Departments of Child Neurology, Neurology, and Genetics between the years 1992 and 2010 and detected 12 patients with unilateral cerebellar volume loss, with the exclusion of all other cerebellar pathologies. The ages of patients ranged between 6 months to 55 years. Five patients had a delay in developmental milestones, and one of these was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1. Two patients had epileptic seizures, one patient had peripheral facial paralysis as a component of Moebius syndrome, and four patients were incidentally diagnosed during etiological work-up for headache. The clinical outcomes of patients varied from healthy subjects to marked developmental impairment. Radiologically, five patients had severe disproportionate UCH, six had moderate disproportionate, and one had mild proportionate UCH. Cerebellar peduncles were affected in all, and vermis was partly hypoplastic in eight patients. Brainstem was involved in four patients, and seven patients showed involvement of white matter and/or corpus callosum. Imaging features supported that patients with severe disproportionate UCH also displayed additional cerebral and commissural changes, which were related to ischemic or vascular injuries, implying a prenatally acquired disruption. In the presence of such a wide spectrum of clinical and radiological features, a prenatally acquired lesion and, thus, a disruption seem to be more explanatory rather than a primary developmental process or malformation in the etiopathogenesis of unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia.",

Various anterior and posterior surgical approaches for a chronic AARF have been reported because of the difficulty encountered in obtaining reduction.PURPOSE: To describe a novel technique of reduction of a chronic AARF using a temporary transverse transatlantal rod.STUDY DESIGN: Technical report.METHODS: A 13-year-old girl presented with an 8-month-old chronic AARF with typical torticollis and \"cock-robin\" posture of the head with a normal neurology. As closed reduction with skull traction for 2 weeks failed to reduce the deformity, the patient underwent C1-C2 fusion. C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screws were inserted under computer navigation. A temporary transverse rod across the atlas and axis was placed to secure a three-column fixation to derotate the subluxed atlas into anatomical alignment. Rods were then connected between the C1 lateral masses and the C2 pedicle screws and fusion obtained with autologous iliac crest grafts.RESULT: Anatomic reduction of the atlantoaxial region was obtained without neural compromise, and satisfactory fusion was observed at 6-months follow-up.CONCLUSION: A temporary transatlantal rod provides a secure anchor point for easy maneuverability for reduction of a chronic AARF and has the advantage of being used even in the absence of the posterior arch of the atlas.",

In the context of a formative evaluation referring clinician and patient satisfaction with a teleneurophysiology service was examined during a 20 week pilot period.METHODS: Questionnaire surveys of referring clinicians and patients were conducted.RESULTS: Fifteen (58%) clinicians responded to the first part of a postal survey which examined their satisfaction with traditional clinical neurophysiology services. Nine (35%) responded to a second part which assessed their experience with the teleneurophysiology service. Teleneurophysiology improved satisfaction with waiting times, availability of results and impact on patient management. There was unanimous support from the clinicians for the permanent development of a teleneurophysiology service, although 2 cautioned this could delay establishing a neurology service in their region.Eighty-two percent (116/142) of patients responded to a survey of their satisfaction with teleneurophysiology. This was compared to a previous report of 322 patients' experience with traditional CN services in Ireland. Waiting times for appointment were shorter for the former group who supported the telemedicine model recognising that it reduced the travel burden and need for overnight journeys. The two groups were equally anxious about the investigation although the teleneurophysiology patients received more prior information.CONCLUSION: This study illustrates that teleneurophysiology is an acceptable model of service delivery for its primary customers. Their feedback is important in informing appropriate design and governance of such innovative models of health service provision.",

A 55-year-old patient presented with loss of sensation in the fingers and loss of peripheral pulsations in the right arm 4 days after right upper lobectomy for a pT2N1 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. Duplex examination and computed tomography were performed the same day and showed a subtotal stenosis of the right subclavian artery, which was caused by the surgical placement of a metal clip to mark the surgical boundary. Selective angiography was subsequently performed. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) successfully dilated the stenosis and pushed the clip off. Flow in the right subclavian artery (RSA) was completely restored as were neurology and peripheral pulses. In conclusion, arterial stenosis by a surgical (marking) clip may be feasibly treated with PTA.",

The case group who received Donepezil medication was examined by TCD before (baseline), after 4 weeks of oral treatment with 5 mg per day Donepezil, and a further 4 weeks of 10mg per day Donepezil, orally. The control group comprised AD patients who did not receive any medications, and were examined by TCD only once. Peak systolic (PSV), end-diastolic (EDV), and mean flow (MFV) velocities of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was assessed by TCD. Also, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was carried out.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the case and control groups, in terms of age and gender. In the case group, the mean MMSE score reached 20.2 +/- 2.8 from a baseline value of 15.8 +/- 3.3 after 4 weeks of oral treatment with 5 mg/d Donepezil, and reached 20.6 +/- 3.9 after 4 more weeks at 10 mg/d Donepezil. In the MCA, the difference in PSV and MFV values after 4 weeks of treatment with 10 mg/d Donepezil was statistically significant compared with the baseline values. In PCA, the values of MFV and EDV after 4 weeks of treatment with 10 mg/d Donepezil were statistically significant in comparison with the baseline value.CONCLUSION: Donepezil (10 mg/d) increased cerebral blood flow velocity and MMSE score in our AD patients, but more extensive trials are recommended.",

Median ABCD(2) scores were comparable, but consultation was associated with hospital admission (odds ratio, 1.35 [1.02-1.78], P = .04) and use of antithrombotics (odds ratio, 1.88 [1.20-2.93], P = .005). The cumulative stroke risk was significantly lower within 1 week (5.3% versus 7.5%, P = .02) but not at 90 days (9.9% versus 11.0%, P = .21).CONCLUSIONS: Consultation was not targeted to high-risk patients but was associated with some quality of care measures and improved early outcomes; however, improvement in 90-day outcomes was not established.",

However, hard data on the disease frequency are not available.METHODOLOGY: All clinical records from patients admitted in the Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia (INNN) at Mexico City in 1994 and 2004 were revised. The frequencies of hospitalized NC patients in neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry services, as well as NC mortality from 1995 through 2009, were retrieved. Statistical analyses were made to evaluate possible significant differences in frequencies of NC patients' admission between 1994 and 2004, and in yearly frequencies of NC patients' hospitalization and death between 1995 and 2009.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: NC frequency in INNN is not significantly different in 1994 and 2004. Between these two years, clinical severity of the cases diminished and the proportion of patients living in Mexico City increased. Yearly frequencies of hospitalization in neurology and psychiatry services were stable, while frequencies of hospitalization in neurosurgery service and mortality significantly decreased between 1995 and 2009.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a stable tendency of hospital cases during the last decade that should encourage to redouble efforts to control this ancient disease.",

The psychiatrist Graziella Magherini described, in tourists visiting Florence, acute attacks including disorders of thought and affects, and even including, anxiety attack. She named it the Stendhal syndrome (SS) remembering the experience of the writer when visiting the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence.METHODS: We attempt to investigate the incidence of SS or isolated symptoms related to it, in a homogeneous group of travellers. We review other artists who experienced emotion sickness during their trips throughout history.RESULTS: At the end of the III Neurohistory Meeting (Spanish Neurology Society, Italy, February, 2008) a questionnaire was handed out to the participant neurologists, in order to evaluate if during the practical workshops included in the meeting they had experienced symptoms as those described in SS. A total of 48 questionnaires were completed. The mean age was 50+/-9 years and the male/female ratio 1.7/1. Twenty-five percent of the subjects considered they had experienced a partial SS. No panic attacks or thought disorders were identified, but they did suffer artistic effects, mainly in pleasure (83%) and emotion (62%).CONCLUSIONS: No SS case was identified among neurologists attending this Neurohistory meeting, but most of them experienced mild disorders of affects and one out of four recognized they have had a partial form of the syndrome.",

In addition to Bobath techniques, electrical stimulation was also applied to the supraspinatus muscle, mid and posterior portions of the deltoid muscle of patients in the study group.MAIN MEASURES: Two radiological methods were used to measure the horizontal, vertical and total asymmetry and vertical distance values of the shoulder joint. Motor functions of the arm were evaluated with the Motor Assessment Scale.RESULTS: The hospitalization period was 12.62 ± 2.24 days for the control group and 11.66 ± 1.88 days for the study group. Shoulder subluxation occurred in 9 (37.5%) subjects in the control group, whereas it was not observed in the study group. All shoulder joint displacement values were higher in the control group than in the study group (horizontal asymmetry P = 0.0001, vertical asymmetry P = 0.0001, total asymmetry P = 0.0001, vertical range P = 0.002).CONCLUSION: Application of electrical stimulation combined with the Bobath approach proved to be efficient in preventing inferior and anterior shoulder subluxation in the acute stages of stroke.",

The primary aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the practical utility of TCD to confirm BD when clinical diagnosis was not feasible due to confounding factors. Secondary aims were to evaluate the reasons for inability of TCD to confirm BD and to assess the outcome of patients not brain dead according to the TCD criteria.METHODS: TCD waveforms and medical records of all the patients examined to confirm suspected BD between 2001 and 2007, where clinical diagnosis was not possible, were analyzed. BD was diagnosed based on CCA criteria recommended by the Task Force Group on cerebral death of the Neurosonology Research Group of the World Federation of Neurology. Final outcome of patients and the use of other ancillary tests were noted.RESULTS: Ninety patients (61 males), aged 40 ± 21 (range 3-84) years underwent TCD examination for confirmation of suspected BD. TCD confirmed BD in 51 (57%) patients and was inconclusive in 38 (43%), with no flow signals on the first examination in 7 (8%) patients and the waveform patterns in 31 (35%) being inconsistent with BD. Fourteen of the 19 patients who had CCA pattern in at least one artery but did not meet all the criteria for BD were subsequently found brain dead according to SPECT/clinical criteria or suffered cardiovascular death.CONCLUSION: Using the conventional criteria, TCD confirmed BD in a large proportion, of patients where clinical diagnosis could not be made. The presence of CCA pattern in one or more major cerebral artery may be prognostic of unfavorable outcome, even when BD criteria are not satisfied.",

The purpose of this report is to describe a case of CVT of the cavernous sinus that presented as painful ophthalmoplegia. A 26-year-old woman with a contraceptive implant for seven months consulted at the Neurology Department of Yalgado Ouedrago hospital for a painful ophthalmoplegia that was initially diagnosed and treated as ophthalmoplegia migraine. One month later, clinical symptoms had progressed to asymmetric muscle weakness in all four limbs, right cerebellum ataxia and involvement of the trigeminal ophthalmic branch. Computerized axial tomography of the brain depicted a zone of unusual contrast extending from the cavernous sinus up to the tentorium cerebelli and a mass effect on the fourth ventricle. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a cellular reaction with 8 lymphocytes and high protein rate (0.64 g/L). The levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and D-Dimeres were elevated: 16.6 mg/L and 0.99 microg/mL respectively. Based on a presumptive diagnosis of CVT, heparin treatment was undertaken and led to almost complete remission of the signs and symptoms. This case again shows the wide range of clinical features and outcomes of CVT that can oscillate between encephalitis, intracranial tumor or infection. As a result, CVT should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with focal neurological signs, intracranial hypertension syndrome, loss of consciousness or cavernous sinus syndrome whenever the context is right (post-partum, oestroprogestative, congenital thrombophilia).",

In this phase 2 trial, we aimed to assess whether the sodium-channel blocker lamotrigine is also neuroprotective in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.METHODS: Patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis who attended the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery or the Royal Free Hospital, London, UK, were eligible for inclusion in this double-blind, parallel-group trial. Patients were randomly assigned via a website by minimisation to receive lamotrigine (target dose 400 mg/day) or placebo for 2 years. Treating physicians, evaluating physicians, and patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the rate of change of partial (central) cerebral volume over 24 months. All patients who were randomly assigned were included in the primary analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00257855.FINDINGS: 120 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (87 women and 33 men): 61 to lamotrigine and 59 to placebo. 108 patients were analysed for the primary endpoint: 52 in the lamotrigine group and 56 in the placebo group. The mean change in partial (central) cerebral volume per year was -3.18 mL (SD -1.25) in the lamotrigine group and -2.48 mL (-0.97) in the placebo group (difference -0.71 mL, 95% CI -2.56 to 1.15; p=0.40). However, in an exploratory modelling analysis, lamotrigine treatment seemed to be associated with greater partial (central) cerebral volume loss than was placebo in the first year (p=0.04), and volume increased partially after treatment stopped (p=0.04). Lamotrigine treatment reduced the deterioration of the timed 25-foot walk (p=0.02) but did not affect other secondary clinical outcome measures. Rash and dose-related deterioration of gait and balance were experienced more by patients in the lamotrigine group than the placebo group.INTERPRETATION: The effect of lamotrigine on cerebral volume of patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis did not differ from that of placebo over 24 months, but lamotrigine seemed to cause early volume loss that reversed partially on discontinuation of treatment. Future trials of neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis should include investigation of complex early volume changes in different compartments of the CNS, effects unrelated to neurodegeneration, and targeting of earlier and more inflammatory disease.FUNDING: Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether similar benefits with early intervention of almotriptan can be achieved in everyday general practice, where most migraineurs are managed.METHODS: In this European, prospective, observational study, patients were asked to treat up to three migraine attacks over a 2-month period with almotriptan 12.5 mg administered within 1 h of pain onset and when pain was mild (early + mild intervention group).RESULTS: A total of 501 patients were enrolled in primary care centres across Spain, France and Italy. The intention-to-treat analysis involved 454 patients who reported 1174 migraine attacks, with early intervention being used in 138 of these attacks. A greater proportion of patients who took almotriptan early + mild for their first migraine attack (n = 42) were pain free at 2 h compared with those in the non-early + mild intervention group (n = 410) (62% vs. 35%; p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained for all migraine attacks comparison [65% (n = 138) vs. 38% (n = 1036); p < 0.001]. Other secondary end-points were also significantly in favour of early + mild treatment, including sustained pain free (SPF), SPF with no adverse events (SNAE), and time lost because of migraine (all p < 0.001). Almotriptan was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported.CONCLUSIONS: In the primary care setting, early intervention with almotriptan for treatment of migraine provides significant clinical benefits compared with delaying treatment and/or waiting until pain intensity has progressed beyond mild.",

The SQNS was asked followed by conduct of the BPNS by the neurology resident assisted by a Zambian healthcare worker/translator. 77 patients (48 (62.3%) urban and 29 (37.7%) rural) were enrolled. 13 subjects were excluded due to altered mental status. The mean age was 33.7 years (range 15-53 years; SD±7.81). The SQNS was 95.7% sensitive and 80.0% specific, with 88.2% positive predictive value and 92.3% negative predictive value. Age, geographical location, gender and WHO stage were all unrelated to the performance of the SQNS (p>0.05). Despite its reliance on symptoms alone, this study suggests that the SQNS may be a valid research tool for identifying HIV-associated neuropathy among advanced stage HIV patients in Zambia.",

Accurate early evaluation of these complaints is critical, and appropriate subspecialty clinic referral has public health policy implications.METHOD: This retrospective medical records review included 342 consecutive patients seen at the Neurobehavior Clinic of the University of Colorado Hospital from July 2006 through June 2008. All patients received an initial diagnosis by a clinic attending and subsequent consensus diagnosis by 3 subspecialists board certified in Behavioral Neurology & Neuropsychiatry.RESULTS: Among the 342 patients, 68% had a neurologic disorder, the most common of which was probable AD (17%). The remainder had nonneurologic diagnoses: 20% had a psychiatric diagnosis, 7% had no neuropsychiatric disorder, and 5% had a medical diagnosis. Of those with nonneurologic diagnoses, 65% were referred by primary care providers, and the most common symptom was memory loss (72%). In the psychiatric subgroup, depression was the most frequent diagnosis (56%). All normal individuals had concern about cognitive decline. In the medical subgroup, medication effect was the most frequent diagnosis (50%).CONCLUSIONS: Probable AD was the most common neurologic diagnosis, but 32% of the referred patients had no neurologic disorder, and most of these individuals had a psychiatric cause for cognitive complaints. These results highlight the need for policies promoting more effective use of subspecialty clinics dedicated to neurologic disorders of cognition.",

It affects children and adults. Children are often considered to have epilepsy or a mental health problem. The episodes comprise of recurrent attacks of uncontrollable rage, usually after minimal provocation, and may last up to an hour. Following an episode, children are frequently exhausted, may sleep and will usually have no recall. These features often raise the possibility of epilepsy, and children may be referred for an electroencephalogram (EEG). An abnormal EEG may subsequently lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy and the prescription of an anticonvulsant. Five patients with EDS are described, all referred to a single neurology clinic with a possible diagnosis of epilepsy, one of whom was being treated with an anticonvulsant. Four had an EEG, which was normal in two patients and showed \"abnormalities\" in two, leading to an incorrect diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy in one patient. All five children responded to psychological (behavioural) intervention. Recognition of the clinical features of IED/EDS should preclude the need for EEG and other investigations in these patients and prompt referral to psychological services.",

The results for patients were obtained in a standard clinic day and for the first 10 patients.RESULTS: The mean number of patients/day was 20.7. Thirty-six percent consulted due to headache, most under 50 and women. Half had migraine; in 70% daily activities were moderate-severely affected. Almost half had missed at least one work day due to migraine in the previous month. Neurologist considered that headache background of PCP should improve, mainly regarding preventive treatment. Complementary studies were asked in a rather low proportion of patients; CT (35%) being the most frequent. The majority indicated triptans, and in the mild phase of pain, and neuromodulators or beta-blockers for the preventive treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Migraine is the first reason for consultation in the Neurology Services of our country and impacts negatively in the quality of life of our patients, usually women below 50. Its management should be improved with a better feedback with PCP and the use of the most efficacious treatments.",

The data concerning such risks caused the Italian Ministry of Health to release a statement discouraging doctors from prescribing olanzapine and risperidone outside of the registered indications, in May 2004. This study aimed to analyze the prescriptive profile of AAs in patients with dementia, in terms of the choice of active substance and of the clinical characteristics of the patients.METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of dementia and in treatment with AA (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) were selected from three main Alzheimer Evaluation Centers (Geriatrics, Neurology, Internal Medicine) of the University Hospital in Ferrara, in the period 05/2003-04/2006. For each subject, the following information was collected: the frequency of prescriptions, the drug received, and the amount of AAs in the considered period. In the third year of observation, the intensity of treatment was evaluated (intense treatment: >300 tablets of any AA; weak treatment: <300 tablets of any AA or up to three packages of risperidone drops). Such data were analyzed in terms of the type of dementia, the behavioral disturbance, and the possible presence of psychomotor agitation. In addition, the adverse reactions that occurred during the treatment were gathered. Lastly, the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors among the selected subjects was described.RESULTS: Among the 392 subjects (63% female), Alzheimer's (49%) was the most frequent form of dementia, hallucinations were present in 50% of the cases and aggression in 53%.The statement by the Ministry of Health resulted in a foreseeable increase in the consumption of quetiapine and a parallel decrease in risperidone and olanzapine; subsequently, the distribution among the drugs stabilized to similar percentages. The doses used for the control of behavioral disturbances during dementia were on average much lower than those for treating more severe psychoses. Among the patients followed in the third year of observation (n = 159), the number of subjects in intense treatment was greater than those in weak treatment (60 vs 40%). Olanzapine was the AA most frequently used in intense dosages. Among the patients in weak treatment, about 50% used risperidone, available as oral droplets. In the patients at the Geriatric Center (n = 174), in the initial period of analysis 10 adverse events were observed and out of these 10 subjects, all of whom were under intense treatment , 8 out of 10 took quetiapine. The most frequently observed adverse events were tremors, a typical extrapyramidal symptom.CONCLUSIONS: As physicians await next studies helping to identify specific classes of drugs for specific symptoms or subpopulations, they should turn to pharmacological treatment only after a careful risk-benefit evaluation. They should consider both the important role of the relationship between patient and carers and the adverse effects of antipsychotics, which are particularly dangerous in the elderly.",

The aim of this study was to develop a Turkish version of the S-LANSS and to test its validity and reliability in chronic pain patients.METHOD AND PATIENTS: We enrolled 244 chronic pain patients treated at the Neurology Department. The original version of the S-LANSS was translated into Turkish by standard procedures. An independent clinician determined the pain type (neuropathic vs nociceptive). The reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) and validity (agreement with the reference diagnosis and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) were determined.RESULTS: Two-hundred and forty-four patients with chronic pain (167 women, 43.1 +/- 11.4 years), 137, neuropathic pain and 107, nociceptive pain, were asked to complete the S-LANSS twice. Cronbach's alpha-coefficient was 0.74 for the test and 0.73 for the retest. Total S-LANSS scores for subjects did not significantly differ between applications (P = 0.46). Correlation coefficient was r: 0.97 (P < 0.01), which is fairly high for a self-assessment tool. Compared with the clinical assessment, the sensitivity and specificity of the S-LANSS were 72.3% (95% CI, 64.0-79.6%) and 80.4% (95% CI, 71.6-87.4%), respectively, for both the test and retest. The sensitivity and specificity of the Turkish S-LANSS were similar to those determined in the original validation study.CONCLUSION: This study reports the first validation of a translated version of the S-LANNS into another language. The results suggest that the Turkish version of S-LANSS is a reliable and valid differential diagnostic measure of neuropathic pain in chronic pain patients.",

All constraints relate to work processes and the physical work environment, opposed to safety culture or nursing knowledge, as currently emphasized. The constraints were: cognitive 'head data', temporal workload, inconsistencies in written and verbal transfer of patient data, and limitations in the physical environment. To deal with these constraints, the nurses tend to employ four workarounds: written and mental chunking schemas, bed alarms, informal querying of the previous care nurse, and informal video and audio surveillance. These workarounds reflect systemic design flaws and may only be minimally effective in decreasing risk to patients.CONCLUSION: Cognitive engineering techniques helped identify seemingly hidden constraints in the work domain that impact the problem of patient falls. System redesign strategies aimed at improving work processes and environmental limitations hold promise for decreasing the incidence of falls in inpatient nursing units.",

Areas of enquiry included; 1) multidisciplinary team composition; 2) means of DMD diagnosis; 3) corticosteroid use; surveillance and management for: 4) orthopaedic, 5) respiratory and 6) cardiac complications and 7) health maintenance (nutrition & immunizations).RESULTS: Completed surveys were returned by 14/17 (82%) of physicians. Twelve respondents followed DMD patients. All centres had multidisciplinary teams, including respirology (11/12), child neurology or physiatry (11), physiotherapy (9), occupational therapy (9) and orthopaedic surgery (7). Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/d was used at all centres, which was continued after loss of independent ambulation (11), along with routine calcium and vitamin D supplementation (10). Night splints were prescribed at all centres. Routine surveillance studies included pulmonary function testing (11), sleep studies (10), EKG/echocardiogram (10), bone density (DEXA) scans (10), spine radiography (9), and dietician referral (4).CONCLUSION: Paediatric DMD patients are receiving relatively consistent care in multidisciplinary clinics across Canada, in accordance with recommended guidelines for DMD.",

External validation studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding the predictive ability of the ABCD(2) score. We aimed to prospectively validate the former score in a multicenter case series study.METHODS: We prospectively calculated the ABCD(2) score (age [> or = 60 years: 1 point]; blood pressure [systolic >140 mm Hg or diastolic >90 mm Hg: 1[; clinical features [unilateral weakness: 2, speech disturbance without weakness: 1, other symptom: 0]; duration of symptoms [ <10 minutes: 0, 10-59 minutes: 1, > or = 60 minutes: 2]; diabetes mellitus [yes: 1]) in consecutive TIA patients hospitalized in 3 tertiary care neurology departments across 2 different racial populations (white and Asian).RESULTS: The 7-day and 90-day risks of stroke in the present case series (n = 148) were 8% (95% CI 4%-12%) and 16% (95% CI 10%-22%). The ABCD(2) score accurately discriminated between TIA patients with high 7-day (c statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.88) and 90-day (c statistic 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.86) risks of stroke. The 90-day risk of stroke was 7-fold higher in patients with an ABCD(2) score >3 points (28%, 95% CI 18%-38%) than in patients with an ABCD(2) score < or = 3 points (4%, 95% CI 0%-9%). After adjustment for stroke risk factors, race, history of previous TIA, medication use before the index TIA and secondary prevention treatment strategies, an ABCD(2) score of >2 was associated with a nearly 5-fold greater 90-day risk of stroke (hazard ratio 4.65, 95% CI 1.04-20.84, p = 0.045).CONCLUSION: Our findings externally validate the usefulness of the ABCD(2) score in triaging TIA patients with a high risk of early stroke in a multiethnic sample of hospitalized patients. The present data support current guidelines endorsing the immediate hospitalization of patients with an ABCD(2) score >2.",

Specifically, 7-11 differ formally by chalcogen (O, S, or Se) or chalcogen placement. Solid state comparisons reveal major effects stemming from subtle structural differences which allows for insights into fluorescent crystal engineering. For the 2-heteroatom substitution, an increase in molecular weight (7 < 8 < 9) correlates with an increasing unit cell-volume, a greater orthogonality for the C(4)H(3)X group, and a lower value for Phi(F). Solution and density functional theory (DFT) results reveal interesting platforms for potential in fluorescent studies for neurology. 2-Heterocyclic species show larger lambda(abs,max/em,max) values relative to 3-heterocyclic ones, based on electron withdrawing effects. 10 has the greatest Phi(F) value herein (0.25, toluene). Fluorescence lifetimes were found to be 2.60 (7), 0.74 (8), 0.27 (9), 4.26 (10), and 1.86 ns (11); lambda(em,max) decay was studied for 8. Heterocyclic differences give rise to somewhat different pyrrolic NMR spectroscopic shifts as well. These compounds resist decomposition as seen from titrations with H(2)O(2), and uniformly undergo lambda(abs,max) red-shifting and lowered Phi(F) values as they become brominated with Br(2).",

The possibility of a subclinical myopathy is often raised, and patients may be unnecessarily denied treatment with statins.SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases including Medline, the Cochrane Library and the American Academy of Neurology were searched for existing guidelines. Articles dealing with series of patients investigated for asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic hyperCKemia and articles dealing with myopathies that can present with asymptomatic hyperCKemia were identified and reviewed.RESULTS: The only guidelines found were those approved by the Italian Association of Myology Committee, and the only relevant articles identified describe class IV studies.RECOMMENDATIONS: HyperCKemia needs to be redefined as values beyond 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (which itself needs to be appropriately defined). Pauci- or asymptomatic hyperCKemia with no apparent medical explanation may be investigated with a muscle biopsy if one or more of the following are present; the sCK is >or=3x normal, the electromyogram is myopathic or the patient is <25 years of age. In addition, women with sCK<3 times normal may be offered DNA testing because of the possibility of carrying a dystrophin mutation.",

AED-PDIs were identified using participants' date of initial AED prescription and overlapping concomitant medications. Logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with AED-PDI, including demographic characteristics, chronic disease states, and diagnostic setting.RESULTS: AED-PDI exposure was found in 45.5% (4,406/9,682); phenytoin, a drug with many PDIs, was the most commonly prescribed AED. Cardiovascular drugs, lipid-lowering medications, and psychotropic agents were the most commonly co-administered AED-PDI medications. Individuals with AED-PDI exposure were more likely to have hypertension (odds ratio (OR)=1.46, 99% confidence interval (CI)=1.24-1.82) and hypercholesterolemia (OR=1.40, 99% CI=1.24-1.57) than those without and to be diagnosed in an emergency or primary care setting than a neurology setting (emergency: OR=1.30, 99% CI=1.08-1.58; primary care: OR=1.29 99% CI=1.12-1.49).CONCLUSION: Exposure to AED-PDI was substantial but less common in patients with epilepsy diagnosed in a neurology setting. Because potential outcomes associated with AED-PDI include stroke and myocardial infarction in a population already at high risk, clinicians should closely monitor blood pressure, coagulation, and lipid measures to minimize adverse effects of AED-PDIs. Interventions to reduce AED-PDIs may improve patient outcomes.",

Women could be both teachers and students and made significant contributions to its abundant scientific production. One of the most important of such women was Trotula of Salerno, the 12th century author of the Passionibus mulierum curandorum. De secretis mulierum, de chirurgia et de modo medendi libri septem is an anonymous medical poem from the School of Salerno, which was discovered in a manuscript from the 13th century. It consists of seven books and 7280 dactylic hexameters. The first book is specifically devoted to women's diseases and the second is a treaty on cosmetics. Books III and IV deal with surgery and follow the classical a capite ad calcem formula. The seventh book, De modo medendi, deals with therapeutics. We review the references to neurological diseases, using a critical translation of this text to carry out our study.DEVELOPMENT: The poem proposes therapies to treat epilepsy, headache or tinnitus. The treatment to be prescribed for headache differs depending on its origin. It puts forward pathophysiological explanations for the different types of headache, it relates engorged blood vessels with hemicranial headache, and suggests an excess of phlegm as the origin of mild occipital headache.CONCLUSIONS: Neurological pathology is well represented in this mediaeval monograph on women's diseases. Furthermore, it also shows us the vision that the Salerno physician has of these conditions and the therapeutic arsenal (based mainly on medicinal plants) that was available for use.",

As a result, the bone is brittle but hard and is referred to as \"marble bone disease.\" Although long bone fractures are relatively common, fractures of the spine are rare. Spondylolysis has been reported in the cervical and lumbar spine, and pedicle fractures have been reported in the cervical spine. We report the case of a patient with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis with multiple lumbar pedicle fractures. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of multiple lumbar pedicle fractures in osteopetrosis.METHODS: A 73-year-old woman, with a known history of osteopetrosis, presented with acute nonradiating low back pain following a bout of coughing. The lower limb neurology and bladder and bowel function were normal. The imaging findings, clinical course, and treatment are discussed.RESULTS: Initial computed tomography scans of the patient revealed the presence of multiple pedicle fractures with spondylolysis. The patient was advised bed rest for the first 3 days, and when the acute pain subsided, she was permitted to ambulate with a lumbosacral corset. The patient was asymptomatic for 8 months, when she was readmitted with another episode of acute low back pain. The CT scan revealed fresh fracture of the L4 pedicle, which was not seen on the previous scan. The pain settled down again with conservative measures.CONCLUSION: This case report discusses the rare occurrence of multiple lumbar pedicle fractures and pars interarticularis (spondylolysis) fractures in a patient with osteopetrosis.",

Neurology house staff often must make this diagnosis at times when no EEG technologist is available. We report our experience with abbreviated, emergency below-the-hairline EEGs (BTH-EEG) performed by neurology residents at our institution over a 1-1/2 year period. We analyzed demographic and clinical data in relation to whether or not an ictal or periodic pattem was identified, and these results were compared to follow up EEGs. Thirty-nine studies were identified, ranging in duration from 3 min-13 hrs. Mean and median age of patients included was 53 (range 25-81 yrs); 21 were female. Seven of 39 BTH-EEGs showed at least one electrographic seizure, 9 more showed periodic discharges. Follow-up EEGs showed electrographic seizures in 6 of 39 patients, including 3 of the 7 with ictal BTH-EEG, and an additional 3 whose BTH-EEGs showed periodic lateralized discharges but no organized seizures. All 7 patients with ictal BTH-EEGs survived to discharge, vs. 23 of the remaining 32. We conclude that in selected cases, BTH-EEG is useful in detecting seizures and/or other epileptiform patterns. In our series, when NCSE was in question, the BTH-EEG showed these patterns 41% of the time. The BTH-EEG is a fast, non-invasive, inexpensive tool that may save valuable time, especially when no other viable option is immediately available. This technique may be applicable more broadly, not just limited to centers with neurology residents.",

During one-year period, 8 000 patients were examined at Cerebrovascular Laboratory, University Department of Neurology. Among them, 33 patients (25 male and 8 female) with postoperative ICA occlusion were detected by color Doppler. We retrospectively analyzed the dynamics of ICA occlusion development from the first postoperative follow-up. The risk factors for atherosclerosis were analyzed. In 31 of 33 patients, postoperative ICA occlusion was recorded on the first follow-up examination, 3 months of carotid endarterectomy (18 right and 15 left). In 8 patients, combined occlusion of the common and ICA was detected (4 right and 4 left). One patient developed occlusion during the first year of follow-up, and in one patient it was detected 3 years after the surgery. Eight patients had also had surgery on the contralateral ICA and showed satisfactory findings. In 19 patients, mild atherosclerotic changes were found contralaterally, 5 had moderate stenosis, and 1 patient had subtotal ICA stenosis. The early onset of postoperative ICA occlusion most likely is not caused by atherosclerosis risk factors but by perioperative complications.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether UGT2B7_- 161C>T and UGT2B7_372A>G polymorphisms contribute to the intersubject variability in LTG concentration-to-dose ratio (LTG-CDR) in epileptic patients. Fifty-three white epileptic patients attending the Neuropediatric and Neurology Services at the Marqu?s de Valdecilla University Hospital, in whom LTG serum concentration was to be measured for pharmacokinetic monitoring, were selected according to predefined criteria for LTG-CDR evaluation. All patients had at least one steady-state LTG serum concentration obtained before the first dose in the morning. Patients were classified in 3 groups of comedication: (1) LTG in combination with metabolism-inducer anticonvulsants (n = 22), (2) LTG in combination with valproate (n = 13), and (3) LTG as monotherapy (n = 16) or in combination with valproate and inducers (n = 2). Genotypes were determined by Applied Biosystems Genotyping Assays with TaqMan probes. A significant association was found between LTG-CDR and UGT2B7_-161C>T polymorphism (P = 0.021) when patient age and concomitant antiepileptic drugs were taken into account. Comedication explained 70% of the LTG-CDR variability, patient age 24%, and UGT2B7_-161C>T 12%. In contrast, a significant association between LTG-CDR and this polymorphism was not found in the bivariate study when age and comedication groups were not considered. A significant association between UGT2B7_372A>G and LTG-CDR was not found in the bivariate or the multivariate studies. UGT2B7_-161C>T polymorphism is significantly associated with LTG-CDR when comedication with other antiepileptic drugs and patient age are taken into account in a multivariate analysis.",

After a short period as a spa doctor--work he approached on a scientific basis--he performed one of the first microscopic tissue analyses, as well as writing two significant works with a wealth of pictures on pathophysiology and histopathology, thereby paving the way for cellular pathology. In addition to general problems relating to inflammation, he concentrated on tumors and tuberculosis. He was one of the first to recommend pre-operative histology, making him a pioneer of biopsy diagnostics.As a clinician he worked in nearly all areas of internal medicine, including neurology, and published a large number of monographs, of which the first German monograph on acute articular rheumatism was one. Rheumatology played a considerable role in both his histopathological and clinical activities.Of particular interest is the fact that Lebert frequently travelled between Switzerland, France and Germany and was applauded in all three as a great scientist, as awards from both Napoleon III and the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV can testify.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: The traditional emphasis on developing high specificity pharmaceuticals (\"magic bullets\") for the treatment of Neurological and Psychiatric disorders is being challenged by emerging pathophysiology concepts that view disease states as abnormal interactions within complex networks of molecular and cellular components. So-called network pharmacology focuses on modifying the behavior of entire systems rather than individual components, a therapeutic strategy that would ideally employ single pharmacological agents capable of interacting with multiple targets (\"magic shotguns\"). For this approach to be successful, however, a framework for understanding pharmacological \"promiscuity\"--the ability of individual agents to modulate multiple molecular targets--is needed.PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Pharmacological promiscuity is more often the rule than the exception for drugs that target the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesize that promiscuity is an important contributor to clinical efficacy. Modulation patterns of existing therapeutic agents may provide critical templates for future drug discovery in Neurology and Psychiatry.TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: To demonstrate the extent of pharmacological promiscuity and develop a framework for guiding drug screening, we reviewed the ability of 170 therapeutic agents and endogenous molecules to directly modulate neurotransmitter receptors, a class of historically attractive therapeutic targets in Neurology and Psychiatry. The results are summarized in the form of 1) receptor-centric maps that illustrate the degree of promiscuity for GABA-, glycine-, serotonin-, and acetylcholine-gated ion channels, and 2) drug-centric maps that illustrated how characterization of promiscuity can guide drug development.IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Developing promiscuity maps of approved neuro-pharmaceuticals will provide therapeutic class-based templates against which candidate compounds can be screened. Importantly, compounds previously rejected in traditional screens due to poor specificity could be reconsidered in this framework. Further testing will require high throughput assays to systematically characterize interactions between available CNS-active drugs and surface receptors, both ionotropic and metabotropic.",

      "abstractText": "UNLABELLED: Migraine is a very common primary headache disorder with no underlying identifiable pathological cause. It has a profound effect on the well-being and general functioning of its victims. Migraine is best understood as a chronic disorder with episodic manifestations, progressive in some individuals, having dramatic social and economic costs. Migraine causes stress in patients and their families, changes the roles and lifestyles and disturbs the social interactions between family members. Being more common in women, migraine is a significant women's health concern. The low rate of headaches with identifiable organic causes suggests that individual and environmental factors are determinants of migraine. Therefore, studying lifestyle and its relation with migraine is very important. This study examines the relation between migraine headaches and lifestyle in women refereed to university clinics in Iran.METHODS: This is a case-control study of 170 patients selected randomly using Poisson sampling. The study population included female patients suffering from headache referred to the neurology clinics and health centers in Iran (with neurologist-diagnosed migraine according to the criteria of the International Society of Headache). The study population for the control group included women without migraine headache whose life conditions were similar to the migraine group and who were living in the same area. Data were collected by interview and a questionnaire which was tested for reliability and validity using content validity and retest methodologies.RESULTS: Findings showed a significant relation between some dimensions of lifestyle, such as diet eating habits (P = 0.001), resting and sleeping habits (P = 0.012), and drug usage patterns (P = 0.001) with migraine headaches. But there were no significant relationships noted between smoking, exercise or stress levels with migraine headaches.DISCUSSION: Lifestyle habits, including rest and sleep, diet and drug usage, are important factors in migraine attacks. It is important to emphasize changing habits, such as improper use of analgesics, to decrease side effects in migraine victims. The health centers should consider promoting healthy habits and behaviors as a priority in their services.",

This study was aimed to investigate the clonality of the MRSA strains isolated from patients with nosocomial infection and also to determine the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin in these isolates. A total of 37 samples (31 isolated from surgical wound samples, 2 them from abscess and 4 from drainage samples) obtained from patients hospitalized at surgery, internal medicine and intensive care units, were included to the study. The clonality among MRSA strains was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and the presence of PVL by polymerase chain reaction using luk-PV-1 and luk-PV-2 primers. PFGE revealed that 31 of 37 strains were A pulsotype and subtypes, 3 strains were B pulsotype and the last 3 were C pulsotype. Pulsotype A has been isolated especially from cardiovascular surgery and other surgery departments and intensive care units, pulsotype B from orthopedic and pulsotype C from neurology and neurosurgery wards. PVL gene was not identified in any of the isolates. These results indicated the presence of a dominant clone among MRSA strains in our hospital, however, different pulsotypes may also be present in different surgery units. Continuous molecular epidemiological surveillance of nosocomial MRSA strains and their PVL positivity supply valuable clinical and epidemiological data for infection control and patient follow-up.",

The aim of this study is to analyse this symptom asymmetry as a function of different variables and compare it with other parkinsonisms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 201 Patients with PD were studied. The sample was supplemented with 29 patients diagnosed with MSA-P (according to the criteria established by the American Academy of Neurology) and 17 with PSP (according to the criteria established by the NINDS-SPSP International Workshop). The symmetry was evaluated, based on items 20-23, 25 and 26 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, by subtracting the motor score for the left side from that for the right side. Those patients with a difference of one point or more were designated as being asymmetric.RESULTS: Around 16.4% of patients presented symmetrical clinical symptoms. There were no differences between those patients with or without family history of the disease. Those patients with symmetric symptoms were found to have longer symptomatic disease duration (10.8 vs. 7.9 years), a worse mental state (UPDRS I: 3.9 vs. 3.2), a higher incidence of complications (UPDRS IV: 4.5 vs. 3.2) and had their activities of daily living (ADL) affected to a greater degree (UPDRS II: 13.0 vs. 11.0). Around 48.3% of the MSA-P patients and 52.9% of the PSP patients showed symmetric symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: The degree of symmetry is not useful in differentiating between sporadic and familial PD. However, the observation of highly symmetrical symptoms in a patient with short evolution time indicates that an atypical parkinsonism should be suspected.",

Physician's diagnoses and management were recorded. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to evaluate by psychiatrists afterwards for 4172 subjects scored >or= 8 on HADS.RESULTS: The adjusted prevalence rates of MINI-diagnosed depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, depression and anxiety, depression or anxiety disorders were 12.0%, 8.6%, 4.1% and 16.5%, respectively. The prevalence of depressive and/or anxiety disorder in outpatients visiting department of neurology and digestive diseases were higher than that in patients visiting departments of cardiovascular diseases and gynecology with statistical significance (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence and low identification and treatment rate of depressive and/or anxiety disorders were found in the general hospitals. In order to improve the status quo, training program for physicians and specialists other than psychiatric professionals in general hospitals should be enhanced together with psychiatric consultation.",

Patient's age range was 15-90 years (mean 52.5 yrs); 54 (47%) were males and 61 (53%) females. The most frequent location was the supraselar region in 49 (42.6%) of cases. Total exeresis was performed in 72 patients (62.6%) and partial exeresis in 43 (37.4%).RESULTS: We noted a recurrence among 50 patients (43%), of which 5/15 were papillary and 45/100 adamantinomatous. The mean patient age for recurrent tumors was 50.46+/-14.13yrs and 48.65+/-11.95 for non recurrent tumors. Thirteen patients died (11.3%). We observed a statistical correlation between recurrence, exeresis (p=0.014), and death (p=0.047). Follow-up was longer among females than males and in suprasellar tumor location, papillary type, external epithelium cysts and laxo stellate reticulum.CONCLUSIONS: However a good prognostic factor in craniopharyngiomas was observed in older female patients with complete exeresis, small tumors, external epithelium cysts, edematous stroma, inflammation, and absence of atypical cell and mitosis.",

The results of the analysis of the first 1000 referrals using the new system are presented.METHODS: An intranet referral system was designed by the consultant neurologists. The previous method of referral was by handwritten letter. The electronic template included 'drop-down' menus and mandatory fields to help guide referring teams. An outcome section is completed by the neurology team.RESULTS: An average of 17 referrals was seen weekly. Seventy-seven per cent were seen within 24 h of referral. A consultant neurologist saw 87% of the referrals directly; 13% were first seen by a registrar and later discussed with a consultant. Forty per cent were seen in the ED of which a one-third of the patients were discharged following assessment. The most common reason for referral was seizure(s) or an episode of collapse (28%). Patients presenting with stroke/transient ischaemic attack represented 13.5%, and 12.5% presented with headaches. The management of 79% of referred cases was deemed to have been significantly changed after neurology review.DISCUSSION: The introduction of a neurology consultant-designed and consultant-led intranet referral service has greatly enhanced the delivery of the consult service to patients in our hospital. This referral system contributes significantly to hospital efficiency and to access for patients to specialist assessment.",

We aimed to analyze MSE incidence, precipitating factors and clinical course by studying patients with JME from a large outpatient epilepsy clinic.METHODS: We retrospectively screened all patients with JME treated at the Department of Neurology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria between 1970 and 2007 for a history of MSE. We analyzed age, sex, age at seizure onset, seizure types, EEG, MRI/CT findings and response to antiepileptic drugs.RESULTS: Seven patients (five women, two men; median age at time of MSE 31 years; range 17-73) with MSE out of a total of 247 patients with JME were identified. The median follow-up time was seven years (range 0-35), the incidence was 3.2/1,000 patient years. Median duration of epilepsy before MSE was 26 years (range 10-58). We identified three subtypes: 1) MSE with myoclonic seizures only in two patients, 2) MSE with generalized tonic clonic seizures in three, and 3) generalized tonic clonic seizures with myoclonic absence status in two patients. All patients responded promptly to benzodiazepines. One patient had repeated episodes of MSE. Precipitating events were identified in all but one patient. Drug withdrawal was identified in four patients, one of whom had additional sleep deprivation and alcohol intake. Two patients received inappropriate treatment (carbamazepine, phenytoin).CONCLUSIONS: MSE is a rare event in JME. Precipitating factors are commonly identified and for such cases the treatment response and outcome are excellent, in contrast to other cases with unknown causes.",

JSN has greatly contributed in elucidating and resolving many socio-medical problems. I will take three topics including SMON (subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy), infectious Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Minamata disease. SMON was a new epidemic disease characterized by subacute optic neuritis and myeloneuropathy associated with diarrhea and abdominal symptoms. The research committee clarified that it was a neurological complication of chinoform, a drug for gastroenteritis. CJD surveillance started in 1996 for variant CJD, and uncovered many patients who developed CJD after human dura draft. The government prohibited to use non-inactivated human dura. Minamata disease is an organic mercury poisoning of people who took fish contaminated by mercury in Minamata bay in Kumamoto or in Aganogawa river in Niigata. The factories discharged water contaminated with mercury which was accumulated in fish and shellfish. Still many victims claim for compensation to the companies and government. Neurologists in Kumamoto and Niigata greatly contributed to diagnose and treat the victims and to clarify the cause of the disease.",

Most of the springs in the study area surface out from these altered volcanic rocks. The concentrations of aluminum (Al) in these springs ranged from 13.17 to 15.70 ppm in this region. These high levels of Al were found to exceed the maximum allowable limits (0.2 ppm) depicted in national and international standards of drinking water quality. Therefore, the effect of high Al in water resources on human health was evaluated in this research. A total of 273 people aged above 18 years and living in the Kirazli region (whose water supply is from springs emerging from these alteration zones) and in the Ciplak-Halileli region (whose water supply is provided from an alluvium aquifer) were selected as the research group. For this group, a questionnaire was completed that contained questions on descriptive characteristics of humans and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered by the authors using the face-to-face interview technique. A neurological examination was then performed by the neurology specialist as a second-stage investigation. Finally, 10 ml of venous blood samples were obtained from these people as a third-stage analysis to determine the serum Al levels together with vitamin B(12), folic acid, and thyroid-stimulating hormone parameters. The result typically revealed that the MMSE score was less in 31.9% and there was no statistically significant difference between the two regions. However, the result also showed that neuropathy in the history (including a careful past medical history) was significantly higher in the Kirazli region.",

A young woman developed multiple complications after a simple hysterectomy: pan-peritonitis, post-op deep coma with hypotension, generalized anasarca, hyponatremia, hemolysis, cerebral hypoxia and renal shutdown requiring dialysis and multiple-unit blood transfusions. She survived 43 days in Neuro-ICU, and was transferred to a regular ward where she developed status epileticus lasting for 17 hours. On examination, she had cortical blindness, which the plaintiff believed it was caused by prolonged seizures but actually hypoperfusion/hypoxia of the brain did it. Plaintiff's attorneys jumped to a lawsuit for $80+ millions, accusing defendant for failure to stop her seizures. They took the plaintiff to Honolulu and San Diego to confirm brain injury.RESULTS: On the top of calcarine infarct, she has pseudoseizures or malingering. To inflate the claim for compensation, they cleverly included three guardians ad litem as co-plaintiffs who live in U.S. Mainland. The first court battle was denied at Guam Superior Court on the ground of exceeding one year of Statute of Limitation. Cunningly they manipulated clinical course to stretch the date of discovery of damages in order to move the statute of limitation within one year of filing to the court. They then went on to Guam Supreme Court, where it was struck down. Unconvinced, they went on all the way to the Federal Ninth Circuit Court in California where again it upheld the original decision. The plaintiff lost and never reached the trial court. After two years' legal combat, I have learned hard way defense strategies: (1) Practice defensive medicine, to keep informed consent and tracks of timing of diagnosis and treatment; (2) Avoid factors that may provoke dissatisfaction, anger, or frustration on outcome of treatment; (3) Keep ledger of ambulance chasers and good defense lawyers; (4) Never surrender at the notification from court; (5) Settle out of court, if this can be done reasonably to save time and stress; (6) Keep cool and study carefully the allegations; (7) Consultation with experts in the area involved; (8) Set up trust fund for children; (9) Buy liability insurance and take CME in medicolegal classes.",

Brain MRI was systematically performed in asymptomatic patients under 6 years of age.RESULTS: One hundred patients with a median follow-up of 3.7 years (range, 1-8.6 years) were reviewed. Brain MRI was performed in a total of 94 children. Nine optic pathway gliomas were detected in symptomatic patients. Six children had symptoms caused by the tumor. Gliomas remained stable in 10 patients; 1 symptomatic glioma in an 8-year-old girl required treatment. Spontaneous regression was seen in 1 patient.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that MRI screening of asymptomatic children to detect optic pathway gliomas does not improve the therapeutic decision and should not be performed systematically. We suggest further investigation in collaboration with the French NF Network.",

This is well reflected in Revista de Neurologia, the first journal entirely devoted to Neurology in Spain. Along five years (1973-1977) only 3% out of papers published were devoted to this subject. The functions of the basal ganglia were poorly known. PD was regarded as a disorder of muscular tone, rigidity playing a pivotal role to explain most, if not all, parkinsonian signs. 'Arteriosclerotic parkinsonism', whatever the symptoms might be, was applied to any form of parkinsonism occurring after the age of sixty. Such cases were usually treated by general practitioners, while younger patients were as a rule channeled for stereotactic surgery. Initial experience on levodopa therapy in Spain began around 1970, the drug being initially administered to severely disabled patients after long years of disease course. This, and probably because of the use of somewhat liberal doses of the new drug as well, severe choreiform dyskinesias were particularly common. Unexpectedly, neurologists were newly confronted to unusual, levodopa-related behavioral effects, such as manic behavior and overt hypersexuality, arising interest on non-motor aspects of PD, which had been mostly neglected at the time. Generalized awareness among physicians of PD as a common disorder in a wide age range in the general population, recognition of early signs and, most important, availability of an effective therapy, prompted widespread interest of Spanish neurologists on parkinsonism.",

      "abstractText": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the success of an acute stroke program designed to streamline the evaluation and treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients, with particular regard to the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and discharge disposition based on age in those patients treated with acute stroke intervention.METHODS: Retrospective review of patients at Mission Hospitals in Asheville, North Carolina from January 2006 to October 2007 with sudden neurological deficit identified within six hours of onset. Data were obtained from Mission Hospital's in-house spreadsheet database and the American Stroke Association's \"Get With the Guidelines\" (GWTG) database. Patients were evaluated by a code stroke protocol that included early involvement of stroke-treating neurologists. A chart review of all code stroke patients established the number of patients treated with acute intervention, disposition, and follow-up information.RESULTS: Over the 22-month study period, there were 568 code stroke evaluations. Of all code stroke patients, 27.1% (n=154) were treated with an acute intervention for stroke, usually intravenous thrombolysis. We analyzed treated patients on the basis of age, with the younger age group (YAG) being 79 years or younger and the older age group (OAG) being 80 years or older. Of the patients treated with acute intervention, 58 (37.7%) were OAG. Discharge disposition varied with age: 42.7% of YAG patients went home alone or with home health assistance, whereas only 20.7% of OAG patients went home alone or with home health assistance. The inhospital mortality rate was 10.4% for YAG patients and 22.4% for OAG patients. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was noted in one patient under age 80 and one patient over age 80. This is a symptomatic hemorrhage rate of 1.3%.LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective, observational, post hoc analysis without a standardized follow-up program.CONCLUSIONS: Our Code Stroke Team, with an inpatient neurology service, increased the proportion of stroke patients treated with acute intervention benchmarking with other GWTG participating hospitals in this time period. Aggressive stroke treatment with thrombolytic therapy in patients over age 80 did not show an increased rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.",

The treatment was deplorable, with patients typically suffering from pressure sores and renal sepsis. In the south of England, a spinal unit was not established until the appointment in 1944 of Ludwig Guttmann, who was trained in rehabilitation, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and research. Guttmann devoted himself single-handedly to the care of his patients, turning and catheterising them himself. Within six months, he demonstrated that he could cure their sores and discharge them to a meaningful life. Recognition followed immediately, and doctors came from other units to learn Guttmann's methods and set up rehabilitation centres for spinal patients in the UK.",

Nevertheless, the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this condition remain somewhat unclear.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted involving 140 patients. Data were collected concerning demographic aspects, clinical picture, diagnostic study, aetiology, treatment and progression.RESULTS: There was a predominance of males, with a mean age of 54 years. The mean follow-up time was 25 months. The symptoms that were reported were as follows: numbness, burning pain, tingling or prickling in the nerve territory. Hypaesthesia was the most frequent sign found in the examination. History of another compressive neuropathy was present in 13.6% of patients. The diagnosis was based on the patient record and the neurological examination. The neurophysiological study and complementary tests were reserved for atypical cases. The most common causation was spontaneous and only three cases were found to be secondary to a structural lesion. A third of the patients were receiving pharmacological treatment. Although the clinical picture was benign, in most cases it tended to become chronic. Patients treated pharmacologically did not show a significant improvement in comparison to those who were not given treatment. The most important data for forecasting improvement of the clinical picture were the identification and correction of the factors precipitating compression of the nerve.CONCLUSIONS: Meralgia paraesthetica is a frequent, benign pathology but with a tendency to become chronic that responds poorly to pharmacological treatment. It is important to identify and correct mechanical factors and only in exceptional cases is it secondary to a structural lesion.",

Electrical impedance myography in the assessment of disuse atrophy.OBJECTIVE: To quantify disuse atrophy using electrical impedance myography (EIM), a noninvasive technique that we have used successfully to study neurogenic and myopathic atrophy.DESIGN: We performed EIM of the tibialis anterior of subjects with disuse atrophy secondary to cast immobilization and in their contralateral normal leg. Subjects were studied shortly after cast removal and again several weeks to months after the cast was removed and normal mobility was restored.SETTING: Outpatient neurology and orthopedic practices at a tertiary care medical center.PARTICIPANTS: Otherwise healthy subjects (N=10) with unilateral leg fracture.INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resistance, reactance, and phase measured at 50kHz.RESULTS: The main EIM outcome parameter, phase at 50kHz, was lower in the immobilized leg in 9 of 10 cases. Additionally, when normal mobility was restored, the phase of the casted leg increased relative to its initial measurement in all 10 cases, while it increased inconsistently in the contralateral leg.CONCLUSIONS: EIM may be a powerful tool for the assessment of disuse atrophy.",

The imaging and clinical signs that predict a malignant progression of stroke of the MCA are analysed, together with factors associated with a poorer prognosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 30 patients, who were divided into three groups: patients who had undergone surgery, and patients who had not undergone surgery but were admitted to intensive care or to neurology wards. The surgical procedure consisted in creating a bone window with a diameter of at least 10 cm and a dural opening. The initial evaluation of the patient was performed using the Glasgow scale and the National Institute of Health stroke scale; follow-up was carried out using the modified Rankin scale, the Barthel index and the Glasgow Outcome Scale at six months.RESULTS: Younger patients have a better functional prognosis than those over 60 years of age. A deviation of more than 10 mm from the mean line is associated with a poorer prognosis, as are volumes of infarcted tissue above 350 cm3. Lower scores on the Glasgow scale on admission are associated with a poorer prognosis for survival and a higher number of sequelae, as well as their reduction during hospitalisation.CONCLUSIONS: Age conditions the presence of sequelae in these patients. The presence of clinical signs of herniation (anisocoria, lower initial score or important drop on the Glasgow scale) and imaging signs (displacement of the mean line, volume of infarcted tissue) imply a poorer prognosis. Early surgery in those patients in whom it is indicated reduces the number of sequelae and increases the rate of survival.",

      "abstractText": "Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) of ACTH with CRH stimulation helps distinguish pituitary ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome from the ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS). The usefulness of the paradoxical response of other pituitary hormones including prolactin to CRH remains controversial. Data from 33 IPSS procedures carried out at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Liverpool were analyzed. Patients were selected for this procedure if they had been diagnosed with ACTH dependent Cushing's syndrome and the majority had no obvious pituitary adenoma on Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Satisfactory simultaneous bilateral catheterization was accomplished in 23/33 (success rate 70%). The diagnostic sensitivity of a basal central/peripheral ACTH ratio >2.0 and >3 post-CRH was 94%. In two patients with subsequently confirmed EAS the maximal central/peripheral ACTH ratio was <2.0 on basal samples and did not change following CRH. The maximal central/peripheral prolactin ratio was noted at 5 min post-CRH, coinciding with the maximal central/peripheral ACTH ratio. The intersinus gradient (ISG) of ACTH was paralleled by a consistent ISG of prolactin and in 7 out of 9 patients (with successful bilateral IPSS and unilateral adenomas) the ISG of prolactin correctly lateralized the microadenoma whereas the ISG of ACTH correctly lateralized in 8 out of 9 patients. Neither of the patients with EAS achieved a central/peripheral prolactin ratio >2 in the basal state and >3 post-CRH. Bilateral catheterization of inferior petrosal sinuses can be successful in up to 70% of cases. Prolactin measurements do not have superior lateralizing capability compared with ACTH but may be useful in the differential diagnosis of pituitary-driven from EAS.",

They are usually underdiagnosed even with the relatively high prevalence in certain populations. The diagnosis can be established on clinical data, histopathologic studies and biochemical abnormalities in the respiratory chain, or the finding of the specific causal mutation in the DNAmt.CLINICAL CASE: we describe a patient and her family history, affecting neurologic, cardiovascular and endocrine systems. We established the diagnosis of MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalomy-opathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) with the collaboration of the Laboratory of Molecular Neurogenetics of the Department of Neurology of Columbia University in New York, NY, USA to whom we sent peripheral blood DNA. The DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The study was positive for the point mutation adenine (A) for guanine (G) on the position 3243 of DNAmt. We make a brief clinical description. We also review DNAmt, related mutations and clinical expressions of the disease. We also highlighted the prevalence of DNAmt mutations in certain clinical situations.",

Among variety of proposed procedures, one of the most promising is refilling of cystic cavities of injured brain parenchyma with artificial neural tissue. Recent studies revealed that after allogenic transplantation in rodents these tissue-engineered entities were shown efficient in repair of hypoxic/ischemic brain injury. Human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) was recognized to be an efficient and noncontroversial source of neural stem cells (NSC). The main purpose of this study was to generate HUCB-derived neural artificial tissue and investigate their functional properties. Neural organoids formed on human-originated biodegradable scaffolds within 3 weeks and resembled niche structure where immature stem cells (Oct4+ and Sox2+) and proliferating neuroblasts (Nestin+, GFAP+, and Ki67+) were present. Such aggregates were placed on multi-electrode chips and differentiated toward mature neurons (TUJ1+ and MAP2+). These three-dimensional aggregates in contrast to two-dimensional cultures formed functional circuits and generated spontaneous field/action potentials. Our results indicate that three-dimensional environment facilitates maturation of HUCB-derived NSC what should be considered regarding regenerative medicine application.",

To date, there is no laboratory test that can discriminate AD patients from healthy individuals. In the perspective of recent knowledge, there are three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers which have the highest sensitivity and specificity: A beta(1-40), A beta(1-42), and p-tau. In the present study, 15 'Probable Alzheimer's Disease' (PAD) patients and 15 control subjects were included. PAD patients were selected from the patients of Dokuz Eyl?l University Neurology Department Dementia outpatient clinic and control subjects were selected from the patients who were undergone epidural anesthesia because of any surgical operation. The concentrations of Ab1-40, Ab1-42, and p-tau in CSF were quantified by using ELISA. Also, the effects of 'PAD patients' CSF on the survival of PC12 cell line were assessed. There was a significant decrease of Ab1-40 and increase of p-tau in patients with AD when compared with controls. Ab1-42 concentration was not significantly different between groups. There was a positive correlation between duration of the disease and CSF of p-tau concentration in patients with AD. There was no significant difference in cell line viability values between groups.",

Yet, the doctor-patient relationship is fundamental to both specialties, and the principles that derive from psychotherapy theory and practice apply to that relationship regardless of the specialty. It is common knowledge that a large proportion of patients seen in the context of the practice of medicine have some kind of emotional disturbance. Moreover, patients with organic disease may also have significant emotional difficulties that complicate both the primary illness and its treatment. This experience inevitably has drawn attention to the need for the nonpsychiatric physician to have an understanding and proficiency in psychiatric diagnosis and psychotherapeutic principles. In this article, we consider basic psychotherapeutic principles that are useful in the everyday practice of neurologists and other nonpsychiatric physicians. These skills are important not only for practical reasons, but also because responsiveness to their emotional distress is essential to maintain empathy and caring as cornerstones of the art of medicine. With the use of clinical examples to illustrate these principles, we hope that readers can apply them to their own clinical experiences.",

In these cases vascular remodelling is required. It can be performed with the use of balloons or intracranial stents. This method allows expansion of the therapeutic indications for aneurysm embolization.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present the results of the Leo+ stent implantation with embolization with coils in nine consecutive patients treated between May 2007 and September 2008 in the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology.RESULTS: In 3 cases embolization was complete, in 4 subtotal, and in 2 partial. In 3 cases the procedure was complicated by stroke: in 2 patients directly after the procedure and in 1 patient 45 days after embolization. 1 patient died due to a recurrent stroke over 1 year after the procedure. Technical failure was noted in 1 patient (stent misplacement from target vessel - the middle cerebral artery to the internal carotid artery, and therefore it did not cover the neck of the aneurysm).CONCLUSIONS: Vascular remodelling with intracranial stents in treating wide-neck intracranial aneurysms is a promising method allowing the indications for endovascular embolization to be increased. Nevertheless, it seems to carry a relatively high risk of cerebrovascular thromboembolic complications, especially ischaemic stroke. It also seems that the procedure itself might cause some technical difficulties. The full clinical safety and efficacy need further evaluation.",

The authors retrospectively reviewed a series of aneurysms in patients presenting with visual field deficit caused by mass effect, to analyze the aneurysm's characteristics, the neurosurgical management of these aneurysms, as well as their clinical, visual, and radiological outcomes.METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical charts, neuroimaging examination results, and surgical videos of 15 patients presenting with visual symptoms caused by an aneurysm's mass effect over the anterior optic pathways. These patients were treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Center of Neurology and Neurosurgery Associates, Hospital Benefic?ncia Portuguesa de S?o Paulo, Brazil. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the variables related to partial or total recovery of the visual symptoms.RESULTS: All patients underwent microsurgical clip placement and emptying of their aneurysms. After a mean follow-up of 38.5 months, the mean postoperative Glasgow Outcome Scale score was 4.33, and the visual outcomes were as follows: 1 patient (6.6%) unchanged, 7 (46.6%) improved, and 7 (46.6%) experienced complete recovery from visual deficits. The variables that influenced the visual outcomes were the size of the aneurysm (p = 0.039), duration of the visual symptoms (p = 0.002), aneurysm wall calcification (p = 0.010), and intraluminal thrombosis (p = 0.007). Postoperative examination using digital subtraction angiography showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 14 (93.3%) of the 15 patients.CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial aneurysms causing mass effect over the anterior optic pathways usually present with complex features. The best treatment option must include not only the aneurysm occlusion but also relief of the mass effect. Microsurgical clip placement with reduction of aneurysmal mass effect achieved improvement in visual ability or recovery from visual impairment, as well as total aneurysm occlusion, in 93.3% of the study group. Therefore, this option is well supported as the first choice of treatment for intracranial aneurysms presenting with mass effect over the anterior visual pathways.",

The frequency, characteristics, and outcomes for IHS patients were compared with patients who develop ischaemic stroke outside of the hospital (out-of-hospital stroke; OHS).RESULTS: Forty-six percent of IHS occurred in the department of cardiology or cardiovascular surgery and 60% were associated with surgery or procedures. In comparison with the OHS patient group, the IHS patient group showed an increased frequency of cardiac disease, leukocytosis, and anemia. Cardioembolism, stroke of other determined etiologies, and an incomplete evaluation were more common in the IHS group, whereas large artery atherosclerosis was more frequent in the OHS group. The IHS group had up to a 10-fold higher mortality than the OHS group, with sepsis being the most common cause of death in the IHS group.CONCLUSIONS: IHS has distinct etiologies and stroke mechanisms from OHS. The prevention and management of infection could decrease mortality in IHS patients.",

We analysed for the first time the serology and clinical characteristics of MuSK-MG in a South Asian population.METHODS: 113 patients with MG attending Neurology Units in three state hospitals in the district of Colombo, Sri Lanka were studied. AChR antibodies were tested in all patients whilst MuSK antibodies were tested in patients seronegative for AChR antibodies. Sera from patients with other neurological diseases (OND) concurrently attending the same hospitals were obtained as controls.RESULTS: Four of 19 AChRAb-negative generalised MG patients (21%) were positive for MuSKAbs. Two were women and in 3, disease onset was before the age of 30 years. Although 3 of 4 had ocular-bulbar involvement at presentation, none had facial or bulbar muscle wasting. Two of the 4 patients (50%) had developed myasthenic crisis and had required ventilation. A good treatment outcome appears to be related to early commencement of immunosuppressive medication. None of the patients with ocular MG or OND were positive for either AChR or MuSK antibodies.CONCLUSIONS: MuSK-MG is seen in about a fifth of generalised seronegative MG patients in Sri Lanka. The clinical characteristics are consistent with features described in Caucasian MuSK-MG patients.",

There is still no standard approach to applying the Romberg test in clinical neurology and the criteria for and interpretation of an abnormal result continue to be debated. The value of this sign and its adaptation when walking was evaluated. Detailed clinical examination of 50 consecutive patients of cervical myelopathy was performed prospectively. For the walking Romberg sign, patients were asked to walk 5 m with their eyes open. This was repeated with their eyes closed. Swaying, feeling of instability or inability to complete the walk with eyes closed was interpreted as a positive walking Romberg sign. This test was compared to common clinical signs to evaluate its relevance. Whilst the Hoffman's reflex (79%) was the most prevalent sign seen, the walking Romberg sign was actually present in 74.5% of the cases. The traditional Romberg test was positive in 17 cases and 16 of these had the walking Romberg positive as well. Another 21 patients had a positive walking Romberg test. Though not statistically significant, the mean 30 m walking times were slower in patients with traditional Romberg test than in those with positive walking Romberg test and fastest in those with neither of these tests positive. The combination of either Hoffman's reflex and/or walking Romberg was positive in 96% of patients. The walking Romberg sign is more useful than the traditional Romberg test as it shows evidence of a proprioceptive gait deficit in significantly more patients with cervical myelopathy than is found on conventional neurological examination. The combination of Hoffman's reflex and walking Romberg sign has a potential as useful screening tests to detect clinically significant cervical myelopathy.",

Our aim therefore was to provide a reliable estimate for TIA patients treated in German neurology departments with an acute stroke unit.METHODS: A total of 1951 consecutively admitted TIA patients were prospectively documented in 13 centers and 1480 (75.9%) gave consent for long-term follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 23.4 months, we assessed recurrent cerebrovascular events and cause of death in 1448 patients via standardized telephone interview including confirmation of endpoint events by the treating physician.RESULTS: Overall 94 patients (6.5%) suffered a stroke and 118 patients (8.1%) died, 21 due to stroke. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for stroke during the first year was 4.4% (95% CI 3.2-5.6%) which corresponds to a relative risk of 9.5 (95% CI 7.4-12.3) compared to the population-based stroke incidence in Germany. The annual rates after the first year were 2.2% (95% CI 1.7-2.7%) for stroke and 3.2% (95% CI 2.7-3.8%) for death. Independent predictors for stroke during follow-up were age and previous cerebrovascular events. The ABCD(2) score did not provide any meaningful prediction of stroke risk at 90 days.CONCLUSION: While the in-hospital risk of stroke was low, long-term stroke rates in our well-defined multicenter hospital-based cohort were comparable to a large randomized trial. In patients with a well-established diagnosis of TIA, only age and previous cerebrovascular events seem to constitute independent predictors for stroke during long-term follow-up.",

      "abstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to develop a geographically localized, multi-institution strategy for improving enrolment in a trial of secondary stroke prevention.METHODS: We invited 11 Connecticut hospitals to participate in a project named the Local Identification and Outreach Network (LION). Each hospital provided the names of patients with stroke or TIA, identified from electronic admission or discharge logs, to researchers at a central coordinating center. After obtaining permission from personal physicians, researchers contacted each patient to describe the study, screen for eligibility, and set up a home visit for consent. Researchers traveled throughout the state to enroll and follow participants. Outside the LION, investigators identified trial participants using conventional recruitment strategies. We compared recruitment success for the LION and other sites using data from January 1, 2005, through June 30, 2007.RESULTS: The average monthly randomization rate from the LION was 4.0 participants, compared with 0.46 at 104 other Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) sites. The LION randomized on average 1.52/1,000 beds/month, compared with 0.76/1,000 beds/month at other IRIS sites (p = 0.03). The average cost to randomize and follow one participant was $8,697 for the LION, compared with $7,198 for other sites.CONCLUSION: A geographically based network of institutions, served by a central coordinating center, randomized substantially more patients per month compared with sites outside of the network. The high enrollment rate was a result of surveillance at multiple institutions and greater productivity at each institution. Although the cost per patient was higher for the network, compared with nonnetwork sites, cost savings could result from more rapid completion of research.",

Case 1: A 57-year-old man diagnosed with left neovascular glaucoma was admitted to our department for trabeculectomy (He had complained of decreased visual acuity (VA) in the left eye for a month). A preoperative neck angio CT scan showed bilateral CA stenosis. After CA stenting, he contracted visual defects on the right superior area of his right eye. Upon examination, VA with correction was found to be 1.0 (OD), but right fundoscopy revealed ischemic retina whitening along the inferior temporal arcade. Case 2: A 64-year-old man received left CA stenting for severe stenosis in the Department of Neurology. The next day, he was referred to us for acute onset of a left naso-inferior visual field defect. Upon initial examination, his VA with correction was 0.8/0.16 (OD/OS) and fundoscopy revealed ischemic retina whitening at the superior posterior pole in the left eye.It was not necessary to treat the BRAO in these cases because the foveal capillary network was not invaded at 2 month follow ups, VA was preserved in both cases.In conclusion, ophthalmic evaluation is important after CA stenting because of a possible embolic occlusion of the retinal artery.",

      "abstractText": "Epilepsy is one of the most common diseases in neurology department. It is caused by many different kinds of perturbances of normal balance of excitation and inhibition within the central nervous system. Current clinical antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) targets include ion channels, neurotransmitter transporters and neurotransmitter metabolic enzymes. They could control about 70-80% of the patients' symptoms; 20-30% patients develop to be intractable epilepsy sufferers. Moreover, antiepileptic drugs could not prevent formation of foci and disease process, but only alleviate symptoms of seizures at risk of different adverse effects as the consequences of large doses. Recently, impressive data on the actions of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) prove it to be an inspiring antiepileptogenic target. TRPV1 activation modulates activity-dependent synaptic efficacy: (i) facilitating long-term potentiation (LTP) and suppressing long-term depression (LTD) of hippocampal neurons (ii) selectively inhibiting excitatory synapses onto hippocampal interneurons, which is expected to increase the excitability of innervated pyramidal cells. Nerve growth factor (NGF) can acutely and chronically upregulates TRPV1 expression, suggesting that TRPV1 channels would play an important role in the course of NGF regulated epileptogenesis. Endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) is one of the TRPV1 endogenous agonists. It has been proved that, in the course of epilepsy, AEA levels increases due to enhanced formation and both exogenously administered and endogenously produced AEA display proconvulsant activity. Moreover, TRPV1 activation triggers apoptotic neuronal death of rat cortical cultures, which may be responsible, at least in part, for the volume loss of neocortex in chronic epilepsy. Our hypothesis may broaden the drug screening and designing for clinical strategies for epilepsy treatment.",

The study population consisted of 511 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke (n = 379) or TIA (n = 132) treated at the Department of Neurology, Philipps University, Marburg. Cerebral cardioembolism was defined according to the criteria of the Cerebral Embolism Task Force. Clinical status was assessed by means of Barthel index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale. Costs were calculated using a bottom-up approach. All costs (in Euros) were inflated to the 2008 level. Compared to non-cardioembolic stroke (n = 278) patients, patients who had suffered cardioembolic stroke (n = 101) had more severe clinical deficits on admission (BI 46.3 +/- 27.0 vs. 59.3 +/- 34.1; P < 0.01), worse recovery (BI on discharge 59.2 +/- 28.9 vs. 73.1 +/- 33.4; P < 0.01), and increased LOS (12.6 +/- 5.7 vs. 10.0 +/- 7.8 days; P < 0.01). The latter also required a relatively higher daily resource utilization due to increased expenses for personnel and diagnostics. Mean costs of acute care for patients with cardioembolic stroke [euro 4890 per patient (95% confidence interval 4460-5200)] were significantly higher than those for patients with non-cardioembolic stroke [euro 3550 (95% confidence interval 3250-3850); P < 0.01]. The clinical and health-economic impact of cardiogenic cerebral embolism on stroke care is considerable. Patients with cardioembolic stroke/TIA are more severely impaired, and they require longer hospital treatment and increased resource utilization. Costs of acute care of cardioembolic stroke/TIA patients may exceed those of non-cardioembolic stroke/TIA by up to 40%.",

The educational validity of this practice is unknown. Our objective was to determine whether patient encounter logs correlate with educational outcomes.METHODS: We reviewed patient logs of all 212 neurology clerkship students from the 2005-2006 academic year and determined the number of patients each student saw in five diagnostic categories (seizure, headache, stroke, acute mental status change, and dementia). We compared these numbers with the students' written examination scores (total and category-specific) and clinical evaluation scores using Pearson product-moment correlations.RESULTS: The more patients in a given diagnostic category that students saw, the lower the students' examination subscores in that disease category (r = -0.066, p = 0.03). The total number of patients each student saw did not correlate with the student's total examination score (r = -0.021, p = 0.77) or the student's overall clinical performance rating (r = 0.089, p = 0.23).CONCLUSIONS: Higher numbers of logged patients did not correlate with better clerkship performance, whether the outcome measures were written tests or faculty ratings, and whether the analysis involved total or disease-specific patient counts. Thus, patient census may not be a meaningful index of educational experience or outcome. Considerable time, money, and effort are required to maintain accurate logs of trainees' encounters with patients; based on the current study, this may be an inefficient use of resources.",

We present our CA experience performed by neurologists at an academic institution.METHOD: CA performed between July 2005 and March 2008 was reviewed. Major neurological outcome was defined as a new neurological deficit lasting >24 hours or worsening of pre-existing neurological deficit by 4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Major non-neurological outcomes were defined as any death within 24 hours of the procedure, vascular injury requiring surgery, arteriovenous fistula, or pseudo-aneurysm formation and access site hematoma >5 cm, and/or requiring blood transfusion.RESULTS: In total 661 angiograms were performed over 30 months. CA indications were ischemic stroke in 210/661 (31.7%), hemorrhagic stroke in 321/661 (48.6%), trauma for 16/661 (2.4%), presurgical epilepsy workup 95/661 (14.3%), and other conditions 19/661 (2.9%). Mean age of the group was 49 +/- 18 years. Permanent neurological deficit occurred in .2% (1 patient) and reversible neurological deficits occurred in .2% (1/661). Major non-neurological complications occurred in .9% (6/661). All these rates were less than established guidelines.CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy of CA performed by interventional neurologists is acceptable by current guidelines.",

Patients completed the following scales: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31). Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to identify variables associated with QOLIE-31 overall score. Path analysis model was constructed to test for interrelations between the variables.RESULTS: Two hundred forty-seven patients completed the questionnaires. By multivariate analysis, in order of degree of contribution, HADS anxiety subscale score, MOS Sleep Scale Sleep Problems Index score, HADS depression subscale score, number of current antiepileptic drugs used, and seizure freedom in the past 4 weeks, significantly correlated with QOLIE-31 overall score, accounting for 65.2% of the variance. Complex interrelationships were present between these factors. A general linear model to predict QOLIE-31 overall score in the presence of these factors was constructed.CONCLUSION: Subjective anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance exerted greater effect than short-term seizure control on quality of life scores of patients with epilepsy. These factors should be considered simultaneously when evaluating effects of treatment on quality of life.",

Patients of either sex above the age of 25 yrs who were admitted to Neurology Ward or came to OPD in Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre were included in the study. Type of stroke was identified by brain CT scans or MRI and risk factors for stroke and other details were noted on a proforma. Out of 55 patients studied for present study, 78% were males and 22% were females. Most of them belonged to low socioeconomic status and almost 50% were having family history of stroke. Most of the patients had multiple risk factors which included: hypertension (65%), smoking (32%), diabetes mellitus (36.3%), dyslipidemia (32.7%), coronary artery disease (9%), obesity (18%), epilepsy (16.3%) and left ventricular hypertrophy (3.6%). On the basis of these findings, it can be concluded that hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus are major risk factors for stroke and might be considered as main targets for primary and secondary prevention of stroke.",

The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of neurometabolic diseases in the hospital population, to describe the problems in diagnosing these conditions and difficulties encountered during patient care. Our goal was to propose guidelines for a practical diagnostic and therapeutic approach to neurometabolic disorders in our country.METHODS: We have conducted a prospective study over a 3-year period including all patients diagnosed with \"metabolic disease\" and followed at the Child and Adolescent Neurology Department of the National Institute of Neurology of Tunis.RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients were included (2.4% of our patients). Mean age was 7.3 +/- 5.1 years. Mean age at onset was 4.3 years. There was a high consanguinity rate. Respiratory chain defects were the most frequently suspected diseases (16.9%), followed by lysosomal diseases (8.8%). Chromatography, initially systematically prescribed, became targeted with a higher diagnostic efficacy. Metabolic diseases diagnosed as certain, represented 22% of the studied cases. This can be explained by the insufficiency of available laboratory tests of confirmation. The prescription of specific treatment was insufficient, even for confirmed pathologies (14.7%) because of the high cost of these therapies.CONCLUSION: The diagnostic approach has to be rational, targeted, multidisciplinar and conducted within a care network. Diagnostic priority should focus on treatable neurometabolic diseases. The establishment of a systematized registry and neonatal screening for the main treatable neurometabolic diseases constitute the final objective of our work to prepare for biochemical and genetic studies.",

Unexpectedly, this patient presented dramatical clinical deterioration and revealed clinical symptoms such as bradypsychia, cognitive symptoms, central vestibulare syndrome, spastic quadruparesis. Clinical findings suggested secondary progressive MS, but MRI called in question this diagnosis. The MRI appearance suggested, that MS had been complicated by a different brain pathological lesion, and the brain biopsy was indicated. A histological examination confirmed primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). This case exemplifies important aspects of clinical neurology. A re-evaluation of the diagnosis of MS should always be performed in a patient when new symptoms are presented that are unusual or could be due to other pathological processes. MRI offers the highly sensitive way to detect the coexistence of MS and other brain disease. Primary goal of imaging modalities is differential diagnosis between demyelinating diseases, such as MS and other brain lesions. Advanced focus demand contrast- enhancing and mass- effect lesions. It is important to realize, that contrast-enhancement and brain edema may be mitigated by treatment with corticosteroids. In some cases a brain biopsy is needed.",

Constant, localized compression was applied at the wrist by mechanically lowering a probe attached to a disk electrode, which also served as the stimulating cathode.RESULTS: Compared with the pre-compression values, measurements during compression showed a shift of threshold electrotonus waveforms toward the baseline (fanning-in), steeper current-threshold relationships, increased strength-duration time constants, prolonged relative refractory periods and reduced levels of superexcitability, but no alteration in late subexcitability. These excitability changes indicating depolarization reversed to hyperpolarization immediately after release of compression. The nerve compression altered none of the excitability measures when recorded 2 cm distally from the pressure probe.CONCLUSIONS: Mild nerve compression produces a very localized axonal depolarization at the compression site followed by hyperpolarization upon release of compression, as expected from focal ischemia.SIGNIFICANCE: The current results imply that the sharply-localized conduction abnormalities demonstrated electrophysiologically in peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes and compression myelopathies may, in part, result from compression-induced focal nerve ischemia.",

Prevention of hypoglycemic brain damage by hindering prolonged and profound neonatal hypoglycemia might contribute to psychomotor development. At Erciyes University, between December 1996 and 2005, of the patients who applied to Paediatric Neurology Department, 60 cases with a history of neonatal hypoglycemia were included in the study. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and clinical records of all patients were reviewed retrospectively. It was noted that the sequelae with glucose levels of 0 0 to 40 were more serious and intense. The same results were also observed in cranial MRI evaluation. In conclusion, intractable epilepsy, mental motor retardation, cerebral palsy, and visual disturbance were found to be the most common and severe conditions affecting sufferers of neonatal hypoglycemia. In the first 3 days of life, the close monitoring of patients at risk is critical, and hospitalization of severe cases should be considered.",

Auditory ERPs were performed and parameters of the N2 and P3 components were compared in the patients and controls. Relationships were analysed between radiological indices of atrophy and LA, and NT and ERP results. Results of NT suggested generalised mild cognitive impairment in all the patients. P3 and N2 latencies were longer in the patients than in controls, especially in the LA subgroup. Correlations were found for indices of atrophy, AVLT and ERP parameters. There was a predominant influence of age upon ERP parameters and radiological indices.CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral atrophy and LA result in deficits in memory and attention. NT and ERP may be used as complementary methods in the assessment of cognitive impairment in patients with cerebral atrophy and LA.",

In Zagreb (1926-1946) he was promoted to physician (1932), there he was a student tutor, then the assistant at the Physiology Institute of the Medical Faculty; volunteer, hospital doctor (he got the specialization in 1938), assistant and head doctor of the Hospital for Mental Diseases in Vrapce, and the assistant professor (1941) at the Neuropsychiatric Department of the Zagreb University. In Rijeka (1947-1959) he reorganized Psychiatric and established the Neurology Department of the General Hospital \"Brothers Dr. Sobol\" and, at first, he was the honorary professor, then assistant professor and associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Medical Faculty of Rijeka. In Zadar (1960-1968) he was the manager of the Ugljan Hospital. He published approximately 100 works in the field of clinical neurology, neuropathology, psychiatry, and forensic psychiatry, His works on cortical presentation of the body scheme, hallucinations, tuberous sclerosis, pregnancy and multiple sclerosis, pathohistology of demyelisation, toxic neuritis, epilepsies, nervous manifestations of Malta fever, herpetic infections, pathogenesis of convulsive syndromes, psychiatric terminology, therapies of Parkinson disease and schizophrenia, ability of making will, organization of the psychiatric service, were published in national and prestigious European journals, and often cited. He wrote chapters in psychiatric handbooks and special notes in encyclopedic editions. Together with Stanislav Zupi? he was the author of the first and only psychodrama in Croatia. He was one of the pioneers of neuropathology in Croatia because he founded the Neuropathology Laboratory in Vrapce Hospital in 1936. He had a remarkable preciseness in examining the patient. He was frequent and imaginative lecturer in various sections in Croatian Medical Association and other public institutions. As a gifted polyglot he was occupied by the translation work when retired. In our, till then Middle-European culture-oriented medical area, he introduced values and patterns of French neurological and German neuropathological schools.",

We examined the relationships among patient race, setting of initial diagnosis, and initial treatment for older veterans newly diagnosed with epilepsy.METHODS: We used Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and Medicare data (1999-2004) to identify patients 66 years and older with new-onset epilepsy. High quality care was defined as avoiding a suboptimal agent (phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone) as defined by experts. Predictors included demographic and clinical characteristics, and the context of the initial seizure diagnosis including the setting (e.g. emergency, neurology, hospital, primary care). We used mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression modeling to identify predictors of initial seizure diagnosis in a neurology setting, and receipt of a suboptimal AED.RESULTS: Of 9,682 patients, 27% were initially diagnosed in neurology and 70% received a suboptimal AED. Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to be diagnosed in neurology clinics (black OR = 0.7 95% CI 0.6-0.8; Hispanic OR = 0.6 95% CI 0.5-0.9). Diagnosis in a non-neurology setting increased the likelihood of receiving a suboptimal agent (e.g. Emergency Department OR = 2.3 95% CI 2.0-2.7). After controlling for neurology diagnosis, black race was independently associated with an increased risk of receiving a suboptimal agent.DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that differences in quality of care exist for both clinical setting of initial diagnosis and race. We discussed possible causes and implications of these findings.",

However, there are few reports of BoNT-A treatment in patients younger than 2 years of age.AIMS: To review retrospectively the safety data from all infants treated with botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) before 2 years of age in a paediatric neurology unit.METHODS: There were 74 infants: 28 received the first dose before 1 year of age, and 46 between the ages of 1 and 2 years.RESULTS: In the first year of life, the most frequent indication was obstetric brachial palsy (OBP) (71.4% of cases) and in the second year, cerebral palsy (CP) (73.9%). Both Botox and Dysport, the two commercially-available BoNT-A products in Spain, were used. The average starting dose by session was 6.55 U/kg body weight Botox in infants in their first year of life, and 8.4 U/kg body weight Botox and 21.1 U/kg body weight Dysport in the second year of life. Only 3.6% of cases treated in the first year and 6.5% of those treated in the second experienced adverse events (AEs), which consisted of mild weakness or tiredness lasting 1-4 days.CONCLUSIONS: BoNT-A has a good safety profile in infants younger than 2 years old. AEs are similar to those found in older children.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether cyclosporine increases the risk of neurological involvement in BD.METHODS: Patient files from the Ophthalmology Department for the period 2000-2005 were screened retrospectively, and the occurrence of neurological involvement and its relationship to ocular severity were evaluated.RESULTS: A total of 454 patients with BD were seen at the Ophthalmology Department in this period, including 24 who had been referred from the Neurology Department. Excluded from the study were 47 patients who did not have uveitis and 114 patients with an inadequate follow-up. The remaining 269 patients had been treated with either cyclosporine (Group I, n=92), other immunosuppressants (Group II, n=132), or no treatment other than colchicine (Group III, n=45). Patients with neurological symptoms were sent to the Neurology Department for evaluation: 20 from Group I [10 with primary headache, 1 with depression, 1 with sinus thrombosis, and 8 with parenchymal neurological involvement (pNBD)]; 13 from Group II [10 with primary headache, 1 with pre-morbid epilepsy, 1 with sinus thrombosis, and 1 with pNBD]; and 5 from Group III with primary headache. The frequency of pNBD was significantly higher in Group I, and included atypical features such as seizures and MRI lesions as well as the typical symptoms of brainstem involvement and pleocytosis. Eye involvement tended to be more severe in Group I, and the difference remained significant both when milder cases were excluded from the analysis (6 vs. 0; p=0.03) and when severe cases were excluded (p=0.04). pNBD was significantly more frequent in patients on cyclosporine alone than in those receiving cyclosporine plus another agent.CONCLUSION: In patients with Beh?et's uveitis, cyclosporine seems to be associated with an increased risk of developing pNBD, although the reason for this is unknown. A prospective trial is needed to shed light on this problem.",

The LESS was correlated with neurocognitive and quality of life (QoL) outcomes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The LESS was calculated by assigning 0, 1, or 2 points within each of four different categories (neurology, endocrine, visual/auditory, others). Twenty-three patients with medulloblastoma (n = 18) or ependymoma (n = 5) underwent extensive neurocognitive and QoL testing at a median of 56 months (range, 1-174) after the end of treatment. Eight patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) who underwent tumor resection only served as control group.RESULTS: Patients with medulloblastoma/ependymoma had significantly higher LESS and significantly lower Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)/Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC) scores compared to patients with LGG. There was no statistically significant correlation between neurocognitive performance and QoL. The total LESS was negatively correlated with WAIS/WISC, attention, concentration, and verbal learning scores. Comparison of QoL and late effects in patients with medulloblastoma/ependymoma demonstrated a significant negative correlation only for neurological late effects and the KINDL score suggesting that younger patients with more severe late effects reported on a worse QoL.CONCLUSIONS: This LESS seems to be a simple and practical tool to quantify late effects in former brain tumor patients. Although both groups differ significantly with regard to neurocognitive parameters and severity of late effects, this does not apply for all QoL outcomes. Neurological late effects seem to be most predictive for an impaired QoL in younger children.",

The median age at onset was 48 years (males 53 years and females 34 years). The peak age at onset for males was in the sixth and seventh decade and in females, in the third decade. Two hundred and twenty-two (26.31%) patients had ocular and 616 (73.68%) generalized myasthenia. Serological studies were done in 281 patients with myasthenia gravis for Acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies of which 238 (84.70%) were seropositive. The most common histopathology was thymoma and the second most common was thymic hyperplasia.CONCLUSION: Myasthenia gravis in our study was more common in males (M:F of 2.70:1). There was a single peak of age at onset (males sixth to seventh decade; females third decade). The higher prevalence of thymomas in this series is in all probability related to selection bias as patients with thymic enlargement or more severe disease underwent thymectomy. Thymoma was more common in males; hyperplasia in females.",

Patients A clinical serologic cohort of 15 patients referred for paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation. Seven patients were evaluated clinically by at least one of us. Clinical information for the remaining patients was obtained by physician interview or medical record review.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features, magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, electroencephalographic patterns, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and responses to immunomodulatory therapy.RESULTS: All the patients presented subacutely with neurologic manifestations, including rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, extrapyramidal dysfunction, visual hallucinations, psychiatric disturbance, and seizures; most (60%) satisfied World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for CJD. Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities included cerebral cortical diffusion-weighted imaging hyperintensities. Electroencephalographic abnormalities included diffuse slowing, frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity, and focal epileptogenic activity but not periodic sharp wave complexes. Cerebrospinal fluid 14-3-3 protein or neuron-specific enolase levels were elevated in 5 of 8 patients. Hyponatremia was common (60%). Neoplasia was confirmed histologically in 5 patients (33%) and was suspected in another 5. Most patients' conditions (92%) improved after immunomodulatory therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, radiologic, electrophysiologic, and laboratory findings in VGKC autoantibody-associated encephalopathy may be confused with those of CJD. Serologic evaluation for markers of neurologic autoimmunity, including VGKC autoantibodies, may be warranted in suspected CJD cases.",

They were divided into two groups according to the presence of patent foramen ovale: MWA_RLsh (with right-to-left shunt) and MWA_RLNsh (without right-to-left shunt). Differences between the groups were analyzed according to endpoints of age, gender, clinical severity, aura type and attacks frequency, comorbility, cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), neuroimaging findings, severity of shunt and treatment.RESULTS: n=94; MWA_RLsh: 47 (54%). MWA_RLNsh: 40 (46%). Age: 33.13; standard desviation (SD): 10.8 vs 33.496; SD: 11.2; p=0.728. Female: 66 vs 72.5%; p=0.511. Visual aura: 73.9% vs 78.9%; p=0.921. There were no significant differences in regards to the risk factors studied or to the comorbid diseases that are associated to migraine. The patients with patent foramen ovale have an odds ratio (OR) of ischemic stroke: 1.189 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.226 to 6.248; p=0.840), OR for subclinical brain lesions in cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): 0.589 (95% CI: 0.193 to 1.799; p=0.35) and OR for combined previous ischemic stroke and subclinical brain lesions: 0.745 (95% CI: 0.261 to 2.129; p=0.58). Migraine attack frequency >1 per month: 27.9 vs 36.4; p=0.464. Need for prophylaxis therapy: 44.7 vs 57.7%; p=0.284.CONCLUSIONS: Both groups are similar regarding their clinical profile. We did not find a greater prevalence of stroke or silent brain lesions in the group with positive shunt..",

Its aetiology is unknown, but it is positively associated with the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in all studied populations. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of HLA class II DRB1/DQB1 alleles with narcolepsy-cataplexy in Mexican Mestizo patients.METHODS: This is a case-control study of consecutive patients and ethnically matched controls. We included 32 patients diagnosed with typical narcolepsy-cataplexy, of the National Institute of Neurology, of the Institute of Psychiatry and at the Center of Narcolepsy at Stanford University. As healthy controls, 203 Mexican Mestizos were included. DRB1 alleles were identified using sequence based typing. A PCR-SSOP reverse dot blot was used for DQB1 typing. Allele frequency was calculated by direct counting and the significance of the differences was assessed using the Yates Chi square. Odds ratio and confidence intervals were evaluated.RESULTS: HLA-DRB1*1501 (OR = 8.2; pc < 0.0001) and DQB1*0602 (OR = 8.4; pc < 0.0001) were found positively associated with narcolepsy. When deleting DQB1*0602+ patients from the analysis, DQB1*0301 was also found increased (OR = 2.7; p = 0.035; pc = NS). DQB1*0602/DQB1*0301 genotype was present in 15.6% of the cases (OR = 11.5; p = 0.00035), conferring a high risk. DRB1*0407 (OR = 0.2; p = 0.016 pc = NS) and DQB1*0302(OR = 0.4; p = 0.017, pc = NS) were found decreased in the patients. The gender stratification analysis showed a higher risk in females carrying DRB1*1501 (OR = 15.8, pc < 0.0001) and DQB1*0602 (OR = 19.8, pc < 0.0001) than in males (OR = 5.0 for both alleles; p = 0.012, pc = NS for DRB1 & p = 0.0012, pc = 0.017 for DQB1). The susceptibility alleles found in Mexicans with narcolepsy are also present in Japanese and Caucasians; DRB1*04 linked protection has also been shown in Koreans. A stronger HLA association is suggested in females, in accordance with the sexual dimorphism claimed previously.CONCLUSION: This knowledge may contribute to a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis in different populations. The evaluation of the risk to develop narcolepsy-cataplexy in carriers of the described alleles/genotypes may also be possible. A larger sample should be analysed in Mexican and in other Hispanic patients to confirm these results.",

The possibility of cardiac involvement in the pathogenesis of SUDEP has been suggested by many previous studies. This study compared the QT interval in epilepsy patients and normal controls, and identified the factors that affected the QT interval. Standard 12-lead ECGs were recorded from 70 consecutive epilepsy patients from the neurology clinic of HUKM and 70 age, race and gender matched controls. The mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was calculated and compared. The mean QTc among the epilepsy patients was 0.401 +/- 0.027s. It was significantly shorter than the QTc (0.420 +/- 0.027s) in the control group (p<0.0005). Thirty five epilepsy patients (50%) and 17 matched controls (24.3%) had a mean QTc shorter than 0.40s (p=0.001). Among the epilepsy patients, the mean QTc did not significantly differ between patients in the duration (F=0.836, p=0.438) of the epilepsy, frequency (F=0.273, p=0.845) and types of seizures (p=0.633). There was no significant difference in the mean QTc between the epilepsy patients on different number of antiepileptic agents (F=0.444, p=0.643). Patients with cryptogenic epilepsy had a mean QTc of 0.392 +/- 0.029s, which was significantly shorter than patients with symptomatic epilepsy (QTc = 0.410 +/- 0.027s, p = 0.015). The mean QTc of the same subjects showed no significant interobserver difference (p=0.661). This study, for the first time, demonstrates that epilepsy patients have a significantly shorter QTc than controls, particularly in the subgroup of patients with cryptogenic epilepsy.",

We conducted a descriptive study of stroke patients who were diagnosed less than 12 hours before admission to the Piti?-Salp?tri?re hospital's neurology and stroke unit. Data were collected using a literature review and from existing recommendation. During the study period (August 2003 through April 2005) 310 eligible patients were identified. In 87.5% of the cases, patients suffered from a cerebral infarction and in 10.3% from an intracranial haemorrhage. The initial deficit was mild to severe. The average time between the first symptoms and admission in the stroke unit was 212 +/- 130 minutes. Forty percent of patients who underwent a thrombolysis did so within the first 3 hours. The average length of stay in the stroke unit was 17.5 days. Thirty-one percent of the patients were discharged to go home, 47% to a rehabilitation unit and 8% died. Ten indicators of quality and risk management are proposed, taking in account the events before admission, hospital care, side effects, duration of stay, discharge location and the handicap.",

Stroke in diabetic patients is different from stroke in non-diabetics from several perspectives. There is no local study on this topic. This is the first study from Pakistan, in which pattern of stroke in diabetics have been described and compared with non-diabetics. The object of this study was to compare pattern of stroke in diabetic subjects with non-diabetics.METHODS: This is a prospective comparative cross sectional study, carried out at Liaquat national hospital, Karachi, neurology department from October to March 2006. Fifty patients were enrolled in diabetic group and 50 in non-diabetic. Clinical features, risk factors and stroke patterns were identified.RESULTS: Mean age was 59.5 (+/- 11.82) in diabetics and 60.4 (+/- 14.8) in non diabetics. There was slight preponderance of male patients in non diabetic group. Out of 50 diabetic patients, 44 (88.0%) had ischaemic stroke and 6 (12.0%) had intracerebral haemorrhage. In non-diabetics, 29 (58.0%) had ischaemic stroke while 21 (42.0%) had intracerebral haemorrhage. On further analysis of ischaemic stroke, cortical infarcts (CI) was found in 22, sub cortical infarcts (SCI) in 14, brainstem in 5 and cerebellar in 2 diabetic patients. CI was also the commonest subtype of ischaemic stroke in nondiabetics.CONCLUSION: Patterns of stroke in diabetics are different from non-diabetics. Ischaemic stroke is more prevalent than hemorrhagic strokein diabetics. Sub cortical infarcts are more common in diabetics than non diabetics (p = 0.04).",

Pregnancies with folic acid supplementation showed significant reduction of spontaneous abortion. With regard to monotherapies, in the group of women taking VPA, supplementation of folic acid had significant benefit. Other examined monotherapies (CBZ, PHE, and PB) known to interfere with folic acid showed no significant results.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the prophylactic effect of folic acid supplementation on spontaneous abortion. For AED therapy, folic acid supplementation should be part of the therapy of every pregnant epileptic woman, especially for those treated with VPA.",

A multivariate stepwise linear regression was used to identify the risk factors that were related to SHL as measured by pure-tone average (0.5, 1, and 2 kHz), the high-tone average (4, 6, and 8 kHz), the pure-tone middle-tone average (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz), and the overall average (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 kHz). The following factors were included in the analysis: age, sex, smoking habit, addiction to alcohol, presence of tinnitus and vestibular symptoms, arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemic disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, number of risk factors, neurologic state at the admission, localization of stroke, cause of stroke, number of ischemic focuses, the side and diameter of ischemic focuses, the result of directional hearing acuity angle test, results of certain laboratory tests, blood morphology parameters, and coagulogram. Values for p less than 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTS: Our analysis suggests the presence of the following risk factors of SHL in patients with IS: 1) older age (>60 yr); 2) male sex; 3) presence of tinnitus; 4) arterial hypertension; 5) lacunar type of stroke; 6) presence of multiple ischemic focuses; 7) presence of bilateral ischemic focuses; 8) changes in blood cell count; and 9) disturbances of agglutination.CONCLUSION: The highest risk of hearing loss in the group of IS patients occurred at older people, particularly men with tinnitus, lacunar stroke, multiple, bilateral ischemic focuses, and arterial hypertension. A negative statistically significant influence of decreased level of red cells, platelets, and hematocrit value on hearing loss was found. Abnormally lowered levels of activated partial thromboplastin time, activated partial thromboplastin time ratio, prothrombin index, and abnormal lowered level of international normalized ratio statistically impaired hearing.",

A retrospective case control chart review study was conducted to extract the neurological family histories of Irish ALS patients and controls who attended the National Neurological Centre between January 2001 and January 2006. In total, details were extracted from 197 ALS and 235 general neurology pedigrees. Using the recurrence risk, lambda, ALS (lambda (1st degree)=7.77), Parkinson's disease (lambda (1st degree)=2.67) and dementia (lambda (1st degree)=6.21) were reported more frequently in relatives of ALS patients compared to those of non-ALS controls. Within sporadic ALS kindreds, the presence of neurodegenerative disease was not uniformly distributed. This study supports the conjecture that neurodegenerative disease aggregates within ALS kindreds, and indicates a shared genetic susceptibility towards some neurodegenerative phenotypes.",

The objectives of the study was to explore, whether sheep scrapie could be transmitted to humans and cause CJD.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The occurrence of CJD was studied in a period of 40 years, 1960 to 2000. The first part of the study, which was started in 1980, was retrospective. Hospital records from the Department of Neurology of the National Hospital from the years 1960-1980 were scrutinised and paraffin blocks from the collection of the Department of Pathology from cases with the diagnosis CJD and some suspect cases were obtained and analysed. The latter part of the study was prospective, which gave the possibility to study codon 129 of PRNP gene and characterise the strain of the infectious agent. Information on the epidemiology of scrapie in Iceland and of the diet of Icelanders was collected.RESULTS: Four cases of CJD were detected in the 40 years studied, which corresponds to an incidence of 0.44 per million inhabitants, which is less than half the average incidence in 18 other European countries in the years 1997-2004.CONCLUSION: The low incidence of CJD in Iceland does not indicate that sheep scrapie can be transmitted to humans and cause CJD. If this were the case, we would have expected an higher incidence of CJD and possibly atypical cases, as the Icelandic population has been exposed to scrapie for 130 years.",

Serum ferritin (SF), iron, total iron binding capacity, and hemoglobin were measured prospectively after initial history taking and physical examination, along with other diagnostic testing. We defined iron deficiency (ID) as SF <12 microg/L, and low iron storage as SF </=25 microg/L.RESULTS: Among 106 included patients with syncope, 71 had NMS and 35 had other causes of syncope. Patients with NMS, when compared with those with other causes of syncope, had a higher prevalence of low iron storage (57% vs 17%, P < .001) and lower mean values of SF (27 vs 46 microg/L, P < .001), transferrin saturation (23 vs 31 %, P < .01), and hemoglobin (13.3 vs 14 g/dL, P < .05). Only patients with NMS had ID (15%), anemia (11%), or ID with anemia (7%).CONCLUSIONS: Low iron storage or serum ferritin is associated with NMS and is a potentially pathophysiologic factor in NMS.",

Neurological and neurobehavioral assessments were performed in 55 children with HIV over a 24-month study period. Parameters assessed were physical and neurological assessments, CD4 counts, CD4 percentages, RNA viral loads and an IQ assessment at four monthly intervals. PE was diagnosed when patient developed at least one of the definitive criteria for PE based on the Consensus of Pediatric Neurology/Psychology Working Group, AIDS Clinical Trial 1996. The incidence of encephalopathy was 18.2% (n = 10) in 2002. All the patients had hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, abnormal deep tendon reflexes and five had impairment in brain growth. The CD4 counts and CD4 percentages were more likely to be associated with PE compared to the non-PE group.",

Neurology patients often turn to their physicians for insight into the effectiveness of the therapies and resources to integrate them into their care. The objective of this article is to give a clinical overview of mind-body interventions and their applications in neurology.METHODS: Medline and PsychInfo were searched on mind-body therapies and neurologic disease search terms for clinical trials and reviews and published evidence was graded.RESULTS: Meditation, relaxation, and breathing techniques, yoga, tai chi, and qigong, hypnosis, and biofeedback are described. Mind-body therapy application to general pain, back and neck pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, muscular dysfunction, stroke, aging, Parkinson disease, stroke, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder are reviewed.CONCLUSIONS: There are several conditions where the evidence for mind-body therapies is quite strong such as migraine headache. Mind-body therapies for other neurology applications have limited evidence due mostly to small clinical trials and inadequate control groups.",

To clarify the rate of incidence of such events for these high-risk patients in Japan, a nation-wide cohort study was conducted that was named the 'Japan Thrombosis Registry of Atrial Fibrillation, Coronary and Cerebrovascular Events' (ie, J-TRACE) [UMIN Registered ID C000000189].METHODS AND RESULTS: In the J-TRACE registry, a total of 8,093 Japanese patients with either a history of stroke and/or MI or patients with non-valvular AF were registered. This registry was developed by specialists in cardiology and neurology, physicians working at general hospitals, as well as general practice physicians, from whole regions of Japan, possibly reflecting the real-world medical practice. Recruited patients will be followed up for 2-3 years. Medical history, accompanying risk factors, demographic characteristics, and information regarding the use of medications were collected for these patients at baseline. Cardiovascular ischemic events and serious adverse experiences, including cerebral bleedings, which occur during the follow-up period will be recorded over a maximum of 3 years.CONCLUSION: The J-TRACE offers an opportunity to provide fundamental information regarding the incidence of cardiovascular ischemic events by a stratum of the risk factor profile and current medical treatment for Japanese patients at high risk for thromboembolic diseases.",

The diagnostic yield, prebiopsy diagnostic category, biopsy technique (open versus stereotactic), complication rates, and impact on clinical management were assessed. Biopsies were grouped into one of five categories: diagnostic, suggestive, nonspecific, normal, or nondiagnostic.RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients underwent biopsy. The diagnostic yield (combined diagnostic and suggestive) of targeted serial stereotactic biopsy was 64% (seven of 11 patients); in the open brain biopsy group, the diagnostic yield was 46% (13 of 28 patients). The prebiopsy diagnosis was confirmed in 100% (three of three patients) stereotactic biopsy patients and 75% (nine of 12 patients) of open biopsy patients. Two patients (7%) in the open biopsy group had short-term complications. The clinical impact was similar in both groups: nine of 28 (32%) open biopsy patients and four of 11 (36%) stereotactic biopsy patients.CONCLUSION: Despite the low clinical impact, diagnostic brain biopsy should be considered in patients with nonneoplastic undiagnosed neurological disorders. Patients with neuroimaging abnormalities should preferentially undergo targeted biopsy.",

Its antigen is the astrocytic water channel aquaporin-4; NMO-IgG has not been described in a cancer context.OBJECTIVES: To report (1) neurologic and oncologic correlates for patients incidentally identified as NMO-IgG seropositive in a blinded evaluation for paraneoplastic autoantibodies and (2) the frequency of cancer in NMO-IgG-seropositive patients.DESIGN: Observational, retrospective case series.SETTING: Neuroimmunology Laboratory and Neurology Clinical Practice, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1998 to 2007, we detected NMO-IgG in 2 patient groups: (1) 31 patients (88% female) identified incidentally among 180 000 patients evaluated for paraneoplastic autoantibodies and (2) 141 patients identified through physician-requested serological evaluation for a suspected NMO-spectrum disorder.RESULTS: In the first group, clinical information was available for 28 patients (90%). An NMO-spectrum disorder was diagnosed in 26 patients (93%), of whom 6 had a neoplasm (5 carcinomas [2 breast, 1 lung, 1 thymic, and 1 uterine cervical] and 1 B-cell lymphoma) and 1 had monoclonal gammopathy. In 4 patients, NMO-related symptoms followed neoplasia detection (median, 14 [range 3-18] months), and in 2 patients, symptoms preceded neoplasia detection (by 5 and 3 months). Two patients had carcinoma (1 breast and 1 lung) without neurological evidence of an NMO-spectrum disorder. In the second group, neoplasms were recorded in 7 seropositive patients (5.0%) with a clinically diagnosed NMO-spectrum disorder: 3 carcinomas (all breast), 1 thyroid H?rthle cell, 1 carcinoid, 1 pituitary somatotropinoma, and 1 B-cell lymphoma. An eighth patient had monoclonal gammopathy.CONCLUSIONS: Aquaporin-4-specific IgG in some cases of NMO may reflect a paraneoplastic immune response. The clinical utility of this autoantibody as a cancer marker warrants prospective investigation.",

Earlier data concluding that the higher prevalence of persons with symptoms suggestive of CTS but without evidence of median mononeuropathy highlights the need for a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and natural history of CTS to provide a less empirical foundation for diagnosis and clinical management.OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the clinical manifestations of CTS with the outcome of the diagnostic tools (nerve conduction tests and ultrasonography), and its implication for clinical practice.METHODS: Two-hundred and thirty-two patients (69 male and 163 female, ages ranging between 20 and 91 years) with CTS manifestations and 182 controls were included in this study. Diagnosis of CTS was based on the American Academy of Neurology clinical diagnostic criteria. All patients and controls completed a patient oriented questionnaire, were subjected to clinical testing for provocative tests for carpal tunnel syndrome (Tinel's, Phalen's, Reverse Phalen's and carpal tunnel compression tests), blood check for secondary causes of carpal tunnel syndrome, nerve conduction testing as well ultrasonographic assessment of the carpal tunnel and median nerve.RESULTS: One-hundred and seventy-seven out of 232 (76.3%) had abnormal nerve conduction studies. Forearm symptoms and tenosynovitis confirmed by US examination were found in 51.3% of cases. No significant difference was found on comparing anthropometric measures in the affected hands to the control group hands. A higher prevalence of positive Phalen's and CT compression were found in patients suffering from tenosynovitis regardless of their nerve conduction study results. Sensitivity of Tinel's, Phalen's, Reverse Phalen's and carpal tunnel compression tests was higher for the diagnosis of tenosynovitis than for the diagnosis of CTS (Tinel, 46% vs. 30%; Phalen's, 92% vs. 47%; Reverse Phalen's, 75% vs. 42%; carpal tunnel compression test, 95% vs. 46%). Similarly, higher specificity of these tests was found with tenosynovitis than CTS.CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed that Tinel's, Phalen's, Reverse Phalen's and carpal tunnel compression tests are more sensitive, as well as being specific tests for the diagnosis of tenosynovitis of the flexor muscles of the hand, rather than being specific tests for carpal tunnel syndrome and can be used as an indicator for medical management of the condition.",

Chest radiographic (CXR) evidence of pulmonary TB was looked for in those patients and its frequency, pattern and association with the clinical grades at presentation was determined by using Chi-square test.RESULTS: Out of the 100 patients of neurotuberculosis, with no clinical evidence of pulmonary TB, radiographic evidence of pulmonary TB was seen in only 30% patients. The predominant patterns on CXR were apical infiltration (26.6%), miliary mottling (20%) and hilar enlargement (16.6%). Positive CXR was found in 16.7% patients in clinical grade I and 40% and 43.3% in patients in grade II and III respectively. There was a strong association of grade II and grade III with positive chest radiographic findings (p= 0.03).CONCLUSION: Patients of neurotuberculosis may have chest radiographic evidence of pulmonary TB even in the absence of pulmonary signs and symptoms at presentation. There is a strong association of clinical grade II and grade III with positive chest radiographic findings.",

The significance of iron for brain function is reflected by the presence of receptors for transferrin on brain capillary endothelial cells. Iron imbalance is associated with proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Transferrin receptor (TfR) is the major mediator of iron uptake. Its expression is increased to facilitate iron entrance into the cell. The increased serum level of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) may indicate an abnormal intracellular distribution of iron and a decrease in the cytoplasmic compartment.OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to assess the possible role of iron metabolism dysfunction in the pathogenesis of MS.METHODS: Thirty subjects were selected from the Neurology Department of Kasr El-Aini hospital, Cairo University: 20 MS patients, where nine patients were relapsing and progressive (secondary progressive (SP) of which six were secondary progressive active (SP-A) and three were secondary progressive stable (SP-S)), seven were relapsing-remitting active (RR-A) and four were primary progressive (PP); and 10 control subjects matched in age and sex. Each patient was subjected to a thorough general medical and neurological examination, Kurtzke MS rating scales, laboratory assessment, neuro-imaging, evoked potentials and quantitative determination of the indices of iron metabolism, such as serum iron and sTfR.RESULTS: The serum level of sTfR was significantly higher in our MS patients compared with the control group (p = 0.0001). The levels were significantly higher in SP-A (p = 0.001), SP-S (p = 0.01), RR-A (p = 0.0001) and PP (p = 0.003) patients than in controls. Iron values were within normal limits in all patients. The increased serum sTfR level in non-anemic MS patients with active disease reflects the increased iron turnover. The elevation of sTfR levels in stable patients may indicate active inflammation with ongoing oxidative damage that is not detectable by history or examination.CONCLUSIONS: Iron overload and upregulation of iron-handling proteins, such as TfR, in the MS brain can contribute to pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis and iron imbalance is associated with a pro-oxidative stress and a proinflammatory environment, this suggest that iron could be a target for MS therapy to improve neuronal iron metabolism.",

This virus remains latent in the human host. Their antibodies are detectable in 70% of healthy adult subjects. It is reactivated by different diseases and medical therapies impairing cellular immunity.CLINICAL CASE: A 35 year-old man, smoker, allergic to penicillin and derivatives, with a history of endovenous drug abuse, was admitted to Neurology Department due to a progressive left facial palsy and hand weakness. An alteration in the cellular immune ratio (CD4/CD8 0.07) and a positive human immunodeficiency virus serology were demonstrated. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was started. A unique wide hyperintense subcortical right temporoparietal lobe lesion was shown by a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggesting a differential diagnosis between PLM and low grade glial tumor. Cerebrospinal fluid study was normal and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for JC virus. A steroataxic cerebral biopsy was made in order to establish a correct diagnosis due to patient's age and the good response to treatment. The pathology study showed changes suggestive of PLM and a positive-PCR test for JC virus.DISCUSSION: We report this case to suggest that inva- sive diagnosis methods may be useful to differentiate between PLM and low grade glial tumors and to establish a correct prognosis. HAART is becoming a good treatment option because it seems to make long term survival longer, as is the case of this patient who is practically asymptomatic after more than 2 years of evolution.",

It is a clinical presentation of bitemporal disorders with limbic system abnormalities. The most common cause of KBS is herpes encephalitis.CASE DESCRIPTION: An otherwise healthy 61-year-old woman presented with mental status changes (MMSE-0) after 6 days of severe vomiting. Extracellular dehydration, hyponatremia (107 mmol/L), low levels of natriuresis, and mild hypokalemia were noted. The initial computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal. Over 36 hours of hospitalization in a district hospital she developed unusual neuropsychiatric disorders: hypersexuality, hyperorality, absence, visual agnosia, sensory aphasia, amnesia, and depression typical of KBS. She was then transferred to a neurology department. Clear improvement was visible 3 months later: MMSE-22, moderation of hypersexuality and hyperorality, partial correction of amnesia and aphasia, regression of visual agnosia. But the prosopagnosia (face blindness) persisted, and the patient remained unable to differentiate positive and negative facial expressions.DISCUSSION: Intracranial mass, epilepsy, neuromeningeal infection and head trauma were all ruled out. Antiepileptic and antiherpetic agents were tested without success. There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or inappropriate vasopressin secretion. Only severe vomiting, corrected by water intake, could explain the hyponatremia. The first MRI showed bitemporal edema; 3 months later it showed large bitemporal lesions, both internal and external, with atrophy of the hippocampus and limbic system. These MRI findings are characteristic of KBS. To our knowledge, this is the only the second case of KBS with bitemporal myelinolysis reported related to excessively rapid correction of hyponatremia (increase of 30 mmol/L over 36 h), which leads more usually to central pontine myelinolysis.",

The following were excluded from the study: patients who failed to comply with the treatment or clinical monitoring, or whose medical data were incomplete.RESULTS: There was a predominance of patients aged between 7 and 12 years, with no differences as regards sex. Bilateral and frontal migraine without aura predominated (74%), with episodes lasting between 3 and 12 hours, and the throbbing type accounted for 45% of cases. The most common accompanying symptoms were photophobia (86%) and phonophobia (88%). Except for the second visit, the tendency of the group without prophylactic treatment was favourable. When prophylactic treatment was indicated, a favourable response was observed (p < 0.05), and no significant differences were found as regards the type of medication employed. A total of 73% of the patients were discharged, and most of them required three visits; 30% of the patients treated reported some kind of side effects.CONCLUSIONS: Migraine at the paediatric age is characterised by short but intense episodes of headache that are mostly located in the frontal area. Progress is satisfactory without pharmacological measures in a high percentage of patients. When prophylactic medication was required (due to the patient's presenting frequent episodes of migraine with high scores on the PedMIDAS rating scale), a favourable response was obtained (p < 0.05), with some side effects.",

Our proposals were: a) to describe their clinical features and neurological assessment, and b) regarding thrombolysis, to analyze potential candidates and exclusions at a general tertiary hospital, just before its approval/implementation at the center.METHODS: Cases were retrospectively recruited between May 2001-May 2004. They were identified from discharching diagnosis (ICD-9: 430-439; GRD: 14, 15, 16, 17, 532, 810) and from consultations required to the neurology service. Data collected were: a) admitting diagnosis and service; b) mechanism of stroke (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment, TOAST) and clinical syndrome (Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project, OCSP); c) vascular risk factors and previous symptomatic artherioesclerotic disease (PSAD), and d) prognosis, functional status at discharge (mRankin scale, mRS) and timing for neurological assessment. Every case was considered regarding thrombolytic treatment according to Safe Implementation of Trombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study (SIST-MOST) criteria. Potential criteria for exclusion were registered.RESULTS: 183 cases were included (26 transient ischemic accident, 149 ischemic strokes, 5 haemorrhages). Mean age: 74.5 years, 25.5%, above 80 years. Main sources of patients were cardiology plus related services (31.8%) and internal medicine (18%). Dominant mechanism was cardioembolism (40%). 18 cases (11.77%) were yatrogenic. 55.8% had had PSAD (stroke: 41; ischemic cardiopathy: 31). Mortality reached 33%. 36% were discharged pointing 3 or above in the mRS. Expert neurological assessment was requested in 89%, but just for 25% it was considered an emergency. From 149 ischemic strokes, 5 cases (3.2%) were potential candidates for thrombolysis. Mayor surgery, ageing (>80 years), severe acute disorders or combinations of them precluded thrombolysis.CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital strokes are particularly prevalent in patients with PSAD. Prognosis is poor. In 3.2% thrombolysis could be administered. To make this possible, a right perception of the timing and emergency should be encouraged among hospital staff.",

It is often difficult to delineate where CDH began and medication overuse headache (MOH) supervenes. The current study analyses the development of MOH in people taking regular analgesia for reasons other than headache, namely patients attending rheumatology clinics. The aim of this study was to assess, for the first time in an Irish population of patients, whether CDH was more common in such patients as previously reported. We also wanted to see how often rheumatology patients were taking non-prescribed analgesics. The results show that, in a cohort of 114 rheumatology patients, 32% reported that they suffer from headaches regularly. Of these, 38% fulfilled criteria for CDH (or 12% of the whole cohort). Of the 14 patients with CDH, 11 also fulfilled the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for MOH. Seventy per cent of the patients fell under the category of medication overuse (>15 days a month for > 3 months) but only 9% fulfil criteria for MOH. Contrary to the previous work in this area, we found a very low (< 2 %) incidence of previous migraine in our patients with CDH. We conclude that headaches (both CDH and MOH) are common in this patient population. We suggest that here should be greater awareness amongst all doctors caring for these patients of the potential for creating a second chronic problem when using excessive analgesia to treat the first.",

During the acute phase of the stroke (24h), all patients underwent transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) with assessment of mean blood flow velocity (MV) in the MCAs.RESULTS: We observed significantly lower values of MV in MCAs of both damaged and intact hemispheres in patients with AF as compared to patients in sinus rhythm.CONCLUSION: In patients with AF, hemodynamic disturbances occur within the cerebral circulation during acute ischemic stroke which can cause a more severe course and worse stroke outcome. AF patients need more appropriate prevention of stroke, as well as more efficient treatment during acute ischemic stroke.",

Multiple choice testing was carried out before and after the CD-ROM intervention to assess resident knowledge, and resident compliance with venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines was assessed via inpatient chart review by an independent committee.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in knowledge were measured via test scores and the rate of compliance with anticoagulation guidelines.RESULTS: Multiple choice test scores of 117 residents increased significantly after reviewing the CD-ROM (from 46.7% +/- 15.1% to 77.8% +/- 15.1%, P < .005). As a control, we administered the same test at the same 2 times at a comparable institution but without the CD-ROM intervention and found that test scores did not significantly increase. Chart review revealed a rate of compliance with anticoagulation guidelines for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism of 75% before the CD-ROM intervention, which increased to 95% after the intervention, an increase that was sustained for at least 7 months.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CD-ROM-based interventions might be useful not only in enhancing resident knowledge but also in improving the quality of care by favorably affecting clinical practice.",

Medical records were reviewed to collect demographic data and the clinical data pertaining to epilepsy. An age-matched control group of healthy children in a 1:2 ratio was included to determine the risk factors for epilepsy. For statistical analysis, SPSS, Version 13, was used.RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included in the study group and 111 were in the control group. Epilepsy was classified as follows: symptomatic in 24 (43.6%) children, probably symptomatic (cryptogenic) in 28 (50.9%) children, and idiopathic in 3 (5.5%) children. The etiologies of epilepsy in the symptomatic group included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (n=11), cortical malformations (n=5), neurocutaneous syndromes (n=2), metabolic disorders (n=4), leukodystrophy (n=1), and craniosynostosis (n=1). Twenty-seven patients (49%) were seizure-free at their last follow-up visit for at least the last 6 months; only six patients (10.9%) continued to have normal development at the time of their last follow-up examination. The risk factors for epilepsy included parental consanguinity (P=0.0003), a family history of global developmental delay (P=0.0002), a family history of epilepsy (P=0.010), and a positive perinatal history (P=0.011).CONCLUSION: This study emphasized that afebrile convulsions in infancy are rarely benign. Furthermore, consanguinity was shown to be a major risk factor for epilepsy.",

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of autonomic disturbances in post-stroke patients using selected methods and to analyse the correlation between their results.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The examined group comprised 22 patients (mean age 64.6+/-8 years) with ischaemic stroke treated at the Department of Neurology in Zabrze. The evaluation of the autonomic nervous system was conducted using a questionnaire, cardiovascular reflex tests (Ewing battery) and a neurophysiological method (sympathetic skin response, SSR).RESULTS: All the tests demonstrated coexistence of dysautonomia in most patients. Abnormal score of the questionnaire was present in 72.7% of patients with ischaemic stroke. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction (>or=2 abnormal cardiovascular tests) was diagnosed in 31.8% of patients. Abnormal SSR was found in 81.8% of patients. No association was found among results of the autonomic tests and age, sex, disease duration, aetiology and localization of the stroke focus. The results of the Ewing battery significantly correlated with the questionnaire (p=0.05) and SSR (p=0.03).CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the presence of autonomic disturbances of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system in post-stroke patients. SSR is the most sensitive method and is useful in patients with various degrees of disability. The observed correlation between SSR and Ewing battery confirms the clinical usefulness of the neurophysiological method for the evaluation of the autonomic nervous system.",

Data from patients with epilepsy at the out-patient and in-patient of Neurology Department was collected in a specially designed proforma. Causality and severity of ADRs was categorized as per WHO guidelines.RESULTS: Among 788 patients with epilepsy, 80 (10.27%) had ADRs. ADRs with AED monotherapy were 9.18% and with polytherapy were 11.56%. ADRs with conventional and newer AED monotherapy was 10.24% and 6.84%, respectively, and were maximum with phenytoin and clobazam (14.28% and 12.5%). ADRs were mild in 4.16%, moderate in 70.83% and severe in 25% patients. Causality was probable in 65.62%, possible in 13.54% and definite in 20.83%. Patients (15/80) were hospitalized due to ADRs. Age and gender distribution showed statistically significant difference in occurrence of ADRs (p < 0.05). Chi-square test for poly versus monotherapy and conventional versus newer AEDs did not show any significant difference.CONCLUSIONS: Study showed maximum ADRs with AED polytherapy with no significant difference in frequency and severity of ADRs between conventional versus newer AEDs. This finding needs further investigation in larger number of patients to identify safer treatment options for epilepsy.",

A questionnaire was prepared and submitted to all patients that were hospitalized on the day of the study; the questionnaire allowed gathering a lot of information on exposure factors and clinical and microbiological arguments in favor of nosocomial infections.RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-five patients (59.9% of all available beds) participated in the study. Nosocomial infections were found mostly among people between 20 and 44 years of age and predominantly in women. Fifty-eight percent of those cases were found in the neurology unit. The infections were mostly urinary (40%) and pulmonary (25%). The germs responsible were multiresistant bacteria: Enterobacter cloacae secreting broad-spectrum betalactamase, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected patients were usually under antibiotic treatment (80%) with various protocols, mainly monotherapy. The antibiotics used were betalactams, fluoroquinolones, and nitroimidazoles.",

Patients had a median of 6 treatment sessions (range=1-24). Ninety-one patients completed questionnaires at referral, 63 did at the end of treatment, and 34 did at follow-up after 6 months. Significant improvements were seen on all measures and were maintained at follow-up (CORE-OM, P=.003; SF-36, P<.001; PHQ-15, P=.001). Significance was not lost in an intention-to-treat analysis. Of all the patients, 49.2% improved by at least 1 S.D. in at least one of the measures. The number of patients needed to be treated to see an improvement of at least 1 S.D. in one of the three outcome measures was 2; that in two measures, 3.9; and that in all measures, 7. The mean cost of the intervention was pound231; the cost per quality-adjusted life year was estimated as pound5,328.RESULTS: Psychotherapy was associated with significant improvements in patient-centered measures, which seemed to be achieved at a comparatively low cost.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that psychotherapy may be a cost-effective intervention for patients presenting with functional neurological symptoms. The findings warrant further assessment of this treatment with a randomized and controlled trial.",

It is clinically characterized by alternating remissions and exacerbations, and manifested as diplopia associated with unilateral periorbital hemicranial headache. The symptoms include blepharoptosis, which is usually mild if present, bulbomotor paresis involving the pupil, and loss of sensation in the area supplied by the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Therapy for Tolosa-Hunt syndrome are systemic steroids. The course of disease in a 25-year-old man hospitalized for painful ophthalmoplegia and diplopia is presented. The history included severe pain on rightward eye movement and parabulbarly on the right, considerable defect in the area supplied by the first division of the trigeminal nerve, right hemicrania, and diplopia on looking to the left, right, upward and downward that developed after four days. A month before, the patient was observed at neurology department for severe right hemicrania. Current status included severe pain parabulbarly on the right, discrete proptosis with mild ptosis on the right eye, restricted right eye bulbar motoricity on looking nasally, nasally upward and downward, and loss of sensation in the area supplied by the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Pupilar motoricity was normal. Upon admission, neuroradiologic examination (orbit CT) and brain MR were performed, and therapy with systemic corticosteroids was initiated ex iuvantibus, in consultation with a neurologist. At 24 hours of corticosteroid therapy, the pain subsided, whereas diplopia disappeared almost completely after 5 days, now being only occasionally recorded on looking to the left and upward.",

Reports have been accumulated showing an association of RBD and neurodegenerative diseases. However, in Japan, no data has been available about demographic features of RBD in a large patient population. We describe demographic characteristics of RBD patients presenting to our sleep center with special emphasis on association of RBD and neurodegenerative diseases.METHODS: The subjects were consecutive 10,745 patients who presented with sleep and/or wake problems at our sleep center from April 1998 to March 2006. Diagnosis of RBD was made based on ICSD-2 criteria. Medical and sleep histories with complementary information from family members, and findings of neurological examination were assessed retrospectively from the notes of RBD patients.RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (0.6%) were diagnosed as having RBD. There was strong male predominancy (85.1%). The onset of RBD symptoms was at 61.4+/-8.8 years of age. Neurological symptoms and signs were present in twelve (17.9 % of RBD patients) when they firstly came to our sleep center: 4 patients with Parkinson disease, 4 with multiple system atrophy and 1 with probable dementia with Lewy body. Thirteen patients (43.3%) were aware of olfactory impairment when inquired (out of 30 patients). Clonazepam was administered in 29 patients, and 21 (72.4%) responded well.CONCLUSION: Our study showed the similar demographic characteristics of RBD to what was shown in the previous large case series. Although the association between RBD and neurodegenerative diseases was not so strong in our cases, it may be mainly because our sleep center was not run in the domain of neurology department and we could not vigorously detect the possible coexistence of neurodegenerative disease. The pathogenesis of RBD is still unclear; therefore, neurologists and sleep specialists need to collaborate in following up RBD patients to confirm whether they are at higher risk for developing a neurodegenerative disease.",

Smoking is a risk factor that is associated with arteriosclerotic disease.AIM: To evaluate the risk of having a stroke associated to both active and passive smoking in a case-control study.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted which included 151 stroke patients who were admitted to hospital in the Neurology Service at the Hospital General Universitario in Alicante over a 12-month period. The control group (302) was obtained from patients who visited the emergency department at the hospital with no history of strokes and who reported clinical signs and symptoms that were not compatible with a stroke. The cases and controls were paired according to age and sex, including two controls of the same sex and whose ages were within a year of that of each case which was obtained.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 70.6 years (range: 59-81 years). Males predominated in the sample (57.6%). Stroke patients had a significantly higher percentage of hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, heart disease and dyslipidemia than the control group. The most frequently affected vascular territory was the carotid (33.8%). The most frequent presenting symptom of the stroke was motor syndrome together with language disorders (39.4%). The risk of suffering a stroke associated to active smoking was 1.40 (CI 95% = 0.91-2.15) and in the case of passive smoking it was 1.45 (CI 95% = 0.82-2.58).CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest there is a relevant association between environmental exposure to tobacco smoke and increased vascular risk (which confirms other results that have been published in the literature) and stress how important it is for non-smokers to find smoke-free zones.",

Aside from underlying susceptibility genes, recent studies have also begun to focus on environmental toxic factors. Yet there remains a paucity of information on such factors, making studies of environmental factors important. A recent study in New York City found blood lead concentrations to be elevated in ET cases compared with matched controls. Chronic exposure to lead produces cerebellar damage, and this could predispose individuals to develop ET.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the elevation in blood lead concentrations observed in a single study in New York was similarly present in ET cases sampled from a completely different geographic region.METHODS: Blood lead concentrations were measured in 105 ET cases and 105 controls at Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.RESULTS: The median blood lead concentration was 2.7 microg/dL in ET cases compared with 1.5 microg/dL in controls (p < 0.001). In an unadjusted logistic regression model, blood lead concentration was associated with diagnosis: odds ratio (OR) = 4.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.53-6.37; p < 0.001 (i.e., each 1-microg/dL increase in blood lead concentration was associated with a 4-fold increased odds of ET). This association was more robust when cases were compared with a subsample of controls who did not share the same home environment (OR = 8.13; 95% CI, 3.05-21.65; p < 0.001). In adjusted models, results were similar.CONCLUSIONS: These data replicate those of a previous study in New York and demonstrate an association between the environmental toxicant lead and a common neurologic disorder.",

The objective is to find the prevalence of depression among this population and its risk factors.DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive survey.SETTING: Community of Madrid, Spain.PARTICIPANTS: Sub-Saharan immigrants over 18 years old who attended 2 \"Health Care Programmes for immigrants in the Community of Madrid\" between August 2003 and February 2004.MEASUREMENTS: Semi-structured interviews (DSM-IV criteria) conducted by trained staff and the Beck Depression Inventory were used to diagnose depression.RESULTS: Of 606 Sub-Saharan immigrants, 55.45% were men. Average age was 27 +/- 6.61. Depression diagnosis was 5.4% (95% CI, 3.78-7.56). There was greater risk of depression among those immigrants who had lived in Spain for over 2 years (13.1%), among those who had children (10.7%), and among those with certain health problems, such as muscle and skeletal trouble (18.9%), gastro-intestinal problems (18.8%), neurology problems (17.4%), dermatology problems (20.5%) and fatigue (70.6%). Six percent of immigrants with depression took pharmacological treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression among Sub-Saharan immigrants is similar to that of the native population. There is an increase as they stay longer in our country, probably due to their social and economic situation, which over time can act as a chronic stress factor. The other main fact is the lack of treatment of immigrants diagnosed with depression.",

The health symptoms of WWTP workers were compared with those of water treatment plant workers through a questionnaire survey.RESULTS: Exposure levels for all monitored tasks were less than 1 ppm for hydrogen sulfide and 91 EU/m (endotoxin units/m) for endotoxin. Statistically higher odds ratios of respiratory, ocular and skin irritation, neurology, and gastrointestine symptoms were shown among WWTP workers compared with water treatment plant workers. Tasks related to sludge handling and plant inspection showed statistically significant associations with memory/concentration difficulties, throat irritation, and stomach pain.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that exposure control programs for specific job tasks and work locations are needed.",

The knowledge of this phenomenon induced Ribeir?o Preto to implement the Medical Regulation Office and the Mobile Emergency Attendance System. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of these services on the gravity profile of non-traumatic afflictions in a University Hospital.METHODS: The study conducted a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 906 patients older than 13 years of age who entered the Emergency Care Unit of the Hospital of the University of S?o Paulo School of Medicine at Ribeir?o Preto. All presented acute non-traumatic afflictions and were admitted to the Internal Medicine, Surgery or Neurology Departments during two study periods: May 1996 (prior to) and May 2001 (after the implementation of the Medical Regulation Office and Mobile Emergency Attendance System). Demographics and mortality risk levels calculated by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) were determined.RESULTS: From 1996 to 2001, the mean age increased from 49 +/- 0.9 to 52 +/- 0.9 (P = 0.021), as did the percentage of co-morbidities, from 66.6 to 77.0 (P = 0.0001), the number of in-hospital complications from 260 to 284 (P = 0.0001), the mean calculated APACHE II mortality risk increased from 12.0 +/- 0.5 to 14.8 +/- 0.6 (P = 0.0008) and mortality rate from 6.1 to 12.2 (P = 0.002). The differences were more significant for patients admitted to the Internal Medicine Department.CONCLUSION: The implementation of the Medical Regulation and Mobile Emergency Attendance System contributed to directing patients with higher gravity scores to the Emergency Care Unit, demonstrating the potential of these services for hierarchical structuring of pre-hospital networks and referrals.",

The case fatality rates from stroke are two- to three-fold higher in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, than in the developed world, mainly because of limited healthcare facilities and untreated risk factors. The aim was to determine the prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors among Nigerians with stroke and compare the prevalence of risk factors between young and older adults with stroke.METHODS: The study was cross-sectional in design, and was carried out on stroke patients who were 15 years of age or older, in the medical wards and neurology clinic of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Data was collated consecutively over six months.RESULTS: A total of 81 patients were studied. Sixteen of them (19.8%) were under 45 years old (group 1) while the remaining 65 patients (80.2%) were 45 years or older (group 2). All patients had at least one risk factor. One-third of group 1 patients (37.5%) and 81.5% of group 2 patients had three or more cardiovascular risk factors (p = 0.0004). The most widespread risk factor in all patients, particularly in group 2 patients was systemic hypertension, while dyslipidaemia was most common among group 1 patients. Recurrent stroke was significantly more common among group 2 than group 1 patients (30.8 and 6.3% respectively) (p = 0.045).CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular risk factors, particularly hypertension and dyslipidaemia were prevalent in the studied patients with stroke. The older patients in group 2 had more multiple-risk factors than the younger ones in group 1. Secondary prevention strategies including detection and treatment of risk factors may curtail the burden of the disease.",

The group consists of 48 boys and 22 girls, and the most frequent was the E3 isoform of ApoE. Polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used for the ApoE genotype assessment. The severity of trauma was assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale and graded into three categories. The presence of focal neurology signs, comparing the admission and dimission status, and duration of hospital care were observed. The neurological outcome after 1 year was assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale. Trauma severity was compared with the neurological outcome, according to different ApoE genotypes. For statistical processing, t test, nonparametric Wilcoxon test, Fisher, and chi(2) tests were used.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the association between the ApoE genotype and outcome of traumatic brain injury in children. Patients with ApoE epsilon4 genotype were more likely to have severe clinical symptomatology and unfavorable neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury compared to significantly better outcome with other ApoE genotype.",

Within hours the hypothermias responded to antipsychotic drug holiday. No pathbreaking finding could be ensured on levels of internal medicine, toxicology, neurology as well as neurophysiology including a transient aetiologically uncertain partial insufficiency of the adenohypophysis.CONCLUSIONS: During long-term treatment with antipsychotics especially in higher dosage unpredictable vegetative crises may occur. Antipsychotics having pronounced 5HT2- and D2-antagonism seem to be rather associated with hypothermia. We recommend in case of hypothermia below 35,5 degrees C immediate antipsychotic or anticholinergic drug discontinuation, usage of benzodiazepines like lorazepam for a few days and a following trial with ziprasidone, aripiprazole or clozapine. These atypical neuroleptics show receptor binding profiles potentially advantageous in hypothermia.",

This population is at risk for undergoing repeated computed tomography (CT) scans. The long-term health risks associated with CT scans has been the subject of multiple articles in recent years. In 2002, the National Cancer Institute released a statement that focused on reducing long-term health risks by limiting children's exposure to CT radiation. A retrospective study that included 124 children (ages 2 months-16 years) who presented to our emergency department with epilepsy and breakthrough seizure activity was performed to determine whether the National Cancer Institute statement made an impact on the number of head CT scans ordered. Physician's compliance with the American Academy of Neurology guidelines for emergent head CT scans in patients with known seizure disorder and the diagnostic yield of the head CT scans was also assessed. There was a significant increase (P = .016) in the number of CT scans performed from the years 2000-2001 to the years 2003-2004. Of the 21 children who had CT scans, 15 (71%) children did not meet American Academy of Neurology guidelines for an emergent CT scan. None of the children had an acute finding on CT, and all were discharged from the emergency department. This finding suggests that the yield of emergent CT scans in children with epilepsy and breakthrough seizure activity is low. This study demonstrates the increasing utilization of CT scans in this population at our institution and that compliance with American Academy of Neurology guidelines is not optimal.",

Participants were evaluated at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 and 6 months after stroke. Patients were assessed with the Trunk Impairment Scale, Fugl-Meyer arm and leg test, and Barthel Index.RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included in the study. There were no dropouts. Repeated measures analysis of the recovery patterns of motor and functional performance revealed the most striking improvement for all measures from 1 week to 1 month (P value between .0021 and <.0001) and a significant improvement from 1 month to 3 months after stroke (P value ranges from .0008 to <.0001). No significant improvement was found between 3 and 6 months after stroke for any of the measures. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between time course of trunk, arm, leg, and functional recovery (P = .2565). No significant differences in level of motor and functional recovery were found at the different time points.CONCLUSIONS: Separate analyses of motor and functional recovery patterns after stroke confirm the importance of the first month for recovery. Contrary to common belief, the time course of recovery of the trunk is similar to the recovery of arm, leg, and functional ability.",

In order to perceive relevant information on survival and the cause of death. All patients were followed through phone calls or mailing. The follow-up program was completed in January 2006. Kaplan-Meier methods were used for survival description. Monovariant and multivariant Cox's proportional hazard regression model were used to analyze prognostic factors on mortality.RESULTS: The longest time in the follow-up program was 47 months with 59 dropped-out cases, making the dropout rate as 9.5%. Of these patients, 80 cases died during the period of study(60 for ischemic stroke,3 for cerebral hemorrhage, 10 for cardiac disease, 7 for other cause). The median survival time was 42. 16 months. The survival rates of one-year, two-year and three-year period were 91.9%, 89.4% and 85.3%, respectively. Monovariant and multivariant Cox's proportional hazard regression model showed that the risk factors associated with mortality were old age (RR = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.013-1.074), lower Glasgow scores (RR = 0.855, 95% CI: 0.742-0.985) ,poor conscious levels(RR = 4.085, 95% CI: 2.128-7.844) and having complication (RR = 1.765, 95% CI: 1.108-2.812).CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that the risk factors were old age, lower Glasgow scores, poor conscious levels and having complication on mortality of ischemic stroke.",

The incidence of first-time visits was 18.9 per 1000 inhabitants over the age of 14 years per year. In all, 18% missed their appointments. Results showed that 93.9% of the visits came from Primary Care, with a total mean delay of 30.6 days (16.1 days in the preferential cases and 35.8 in ordinary cases). The most frequent reasons for referral were: headaches (27.2%), cognitive disorders (15.9%), applications for visas or orthopaedic material (8.3%), impaired levels of consciousness/paroxysms with suspected epilepsy (7.3%), dizziness/instability/vertigo (6.8%) and tremor (5.9%). The most frequent diagnoses were headache (28% of the total number; 41.35% of the group less than 65 years old), cognitive impairment (12.24% of the total number; 28.9% of the group equal or more than 65 years old), cerebrovascular disease (8.7%) and epilepsy (5.1%). Patients with a non-neurological pathology accounted for 21.8% of the total number.CONCLUSIONS: In our environment, headache continues to be the leading reason behind referrals to the neurologist. One notable point is the high frequency with which patients without any kind of neurological disorder are referred; the same can be said for those referred for bureaucratic reasons (visas and prescriptions for orthopaedic materials).",

Five sensory abnormality patterns were evaluated.RESULTS: The \"abnormal radial normal sural\" (\"ARNS\") pattern showed a sensitivity of 25% for CIDP and specificity of 100% versus axonal neuropathies (p=0.047). The \"abnormal sural normal radial\" (\"ASNR\") pattern had a sensitivity of 75% for axonal neuropathy with a specificity of 80% versus CIDP (p=0.0012). Presence of ARNS or absence of ASNR patterns showed equivalent or superior sensitivity and specificity to most individual motor demyelinating defects for CIDP. Presence of ARNS or absence of ASNR patterns, integrated within three different sets of electrodiagnostic criteria for CIDP, increased sensitivity in all without significantly altering specificity. Effects were most remarkable with the American Academy of Neurology criteria (1991), which showed significantly improved sensitivity (50-85%; p=0.041), with preserved specificity of 100%.CONCLUSIONS: The use of sensory abnormality patterns appears justified in comparison and combination with motor defects in diagnosing CIDP.SIGNIFICANCE: Sensory studies may be useful in contributing to the electrodiagnosis of CIDP and their inclusion in existing electrodiagnostic criteria deserves consideration.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated both with infections of the central nervous system and with neurological deficits due to direct effects of the neurotropic virus. Seizures and epilepsy are not rare among HIV-infected patients. We investigated the frequency of acute seizures and epilepsy of patients in different stages of HIV infection. In addition, we compared the characteristics of patients who experienced provoked seizures only with those of patients who developed epilepsy.METHODS: The database of the Department of Neurology, University of M?nster, was searched for patients with HIV infection admitted between 1992 and 2004. Their charts were reviewed regarding all available sociodemographic, clinical, neurophysiological, imaging and laboratory data, therapy and outcome. Stage of infection according to the CDC classification and the epileptogenic zone were determined.RESULTS: Of 831 HIV-infected patients treated in our department, 51 (6.1%) had seizures or epilepsy. Three of the 51 patients (6%) were diagnosed with epilepsy before the onset of the HIV infection. Fourteen patients (27%) only had single or few provoked seizures in the setting of acute cerebral disorders (eight patients), drug withdrawal or sleep withdrawal (two patients), or of unknown cause (four patients). Thirty-four patients (67%) developed epilepsy in the course of their HIV infection. Toxoplasmosis (seven patients), progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (seven patients) and other acute or subacute cerebral infections (five patients) were the most frequent causes of seizures. EEG data of 38 patients were available. EEG showed generalized and diffuse slowing only in 9 patients, regional slowing in 14 patients and regional slowing and epileptiform discharges in 1 patient. Only 14 of the patients had normal EEG. At the last contact, the majority of the patients (46 patients=90%) were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Twenty-seven patients (53%) were on anticonvulsant therapy (gabapentin: 14 patients, carbamazepine: 9 patients, valproate: 2 patients, phenytoin: 1 patient, lamotrigine: 1 patient). Patients with only provoked seizures had no epilepsy risk factors except HIV infection, and were less likely to be infected via intravenous drug abuse.CONCLUSIONS: Seizures are a relevant neurological symptom during the course of HIV infection. Although in some patients seizures only occur provoked by acute disease processes, the majority of patients with new onset seizures eventually develops epilepsy and require anticonvulsant therapy. Intravenous drug abuse and the presence of non-HIV-associated risk factors for epilepsy seem to be associated with the development of chronic seizures in this patient group.",

They were identified among all the high resolution magnetic resonance imaging exams performed at our service between 1997 and 2001. The causes of referral were diverse, according to the routine of the neurology outpatient clinic. After magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of the subtype of MCD a detailed clinical assessment was performed.RESULTS: There were 55 females and 45 males, with ages ranging from five months to 71 years old (mean=15.2 years). Seventy-seven patients presented with epilepsy. Sixty-one had partial epileptic syndromes, 13 secondary generalized syndromes, and in three, the type of epileptic syndrome could not be established. Epilepsy was less frequent in patients with the MCD subtypes of polymicrogyria and schizencephaly (p<0.001). Patients with schizencephaly and polymicrogyria had their seizures more easily controlled by antiepileptic drugs (p<0.001).CONCLUSION: That the frequency of epilepsy is lower and seizures are more easily controlled in the setting of polymicrogyria and schizencephaly. Patients with MCD frequently present with secondary generalized epilepsy early in childhood.",

The proposed clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria for MS and connective tissue disorders were systematically assessed in 132 consecutive patients. Cerebrospinal fluid serology and brain or spinal cord MRI were studied in all cases. In patients suspected for connective tissue disorder, schirmer test, rose bengal staining and biopsy of minor salivary glands were performed. A total of 115 (87%) patients were diagnosed to have definite MS, while 17 (13%) were diagnosed to have connective tissue disorder. Positive neurological and MRI findings were observed in both groups. The majority of patients with connective tissue disorder demonstrated extra-neurological manifestations like Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, livedo reticularis, purpura and presence of multiple autoantibodies in their sera. All patients with MS should be screened systematically for connective tissue disorder. In the absence of pathognomonic clinical and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of MS is a diagnosis of exclusion.",

In subsets of patients who had previously undergone QST and/or prospective serial quality-of-life assessments over the previous 5 years, results before and after enzyme replacement therapy were compared.RESULTS: Twenty hemizygotes and two heterozygotes were recruited. The age (mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) of male participants was 40.4 +/- 11.9 years (range 20-62 years); the women were aged between 20 and 56 years. Increasing age was strongly associated with increasing neurological disability. Clinical peripheral neuropathy predominantly affected thermal sensation in all patients, with variable involvement of pinprick and light touch. QST confirmed these findings. Clinical cerebellar tests were commonly abnormal: this has not been previously reported in the absence of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease. There was hearing loss was in 90% of patients and no patient older than 44 years had normal hearing. MRI lesion prevalence increased with age. Despite neurological complications being common, formal cognitive testing was basically normal. QST thresholds for pain showed a significant change after enzyme replacement therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Neurological complications in Fabry disease are common, complex and may be devastating. All patients studied had neurological involvement, with protean and diverse manifestations.",

However, different patterns of deficits are observed following left and right brain damage that suggest affective prosody is a dominant and lateralized function of the right hemisphere. Using the Aprosodia Battery, which was developed to differentiate left and right hemisphere patterns of affective-prosodic deficits, functional-anatomic evidence is presented in patients with focal ischemic strokes to support the concepts that (1) affective prosody is a dominant and lateralized function of the right hemisphere, (2) the intrahemispheric organization of affective prosody in the right hemisphere, with the partial exception of Repetition, is analogous to the organization of propositional language in the left hemisphere and (3) the aprosodic syndromes are cortically based as part of evolutionary adaptations underlying human language and communication.",

Aluminium, which is a proven neurotoxin, is present in significant amounts in illicit heroin and may also be volatilized and inhaled following the vaporization of heroin off aluminium foil ('Chasing the Dragon'). The purpose of this study was to establish if the use of illicit heroin was associated with an increase in the body burden of aluminium. We have used graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to measure the aluminium and iron contents of the urine of current and past users of illicit heroin and used these data to estimate body burdens of aluminium. Urinary excretion of aluminium is the most effective non-invasive indicator of the body burden of aluminium and was found to be significantly (P < 0.001) higher in users of illicit heroin, range 14-3382 nmol/mmol creatinine (mean +/- SD; 222 +/- 491 nmol/mmol creatinine), than in a normal non-drug abusing control population, range 23-74 nmol/mmol creatinine (mean +/- SD; 43 +/- 19 nmol/mmol creatinine). Exposure to aluminium from the use of illicit heroin may be of particular significance because the urinary excretion of iron, another major contaminant of illicit heroin, in users (mean +/- SD; 53 +/- 63 nmol/mmol creatinine) was not significantly different (P > 0.05) from the control population (mean +/- SD; 38 +/- 18 nmol/mmol creatinine). We have shown for the first time that the use of illicit heroin may be a significant contributor to the body burden of aluminium. Further research will be required to determine if adventitious aluminium has a role in heroin use-related neuropathology and neurology.",

Neurological examination and nerve conduction study were done in all patients to establish the presence and pattern of peripheral neuropathy. Clinical data were compared between the groups with and without HIV-related neuropathy.RESULTS: Forty-eight HIV-infected patients were recruited but complete data were obtained in 34 patients. There were 11 males and 23 females with average age of 36.3 +/- 7.3 years. Among these, 17 (50.0%) patients received a diagnosis of HIV-related neuropathy. Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) accounted for 64.7%, mononeuropathy multiplex (MM) for 17.6%, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) for 11.8%, and progressive polyradiculopathy (PP) for 5.9% of cases with HIV-related neuropathy. The presence of neuropathy was not correlated with age, sex, body mass index, and duration of HIV infection. However, patients with HIV-related neuropathy had significantly lower nadir CD4 cell counts than patients without HIV-related neuropathy (p < 0.05). When taking antiretroviral therapy in to account, we did not find correlation of any drugs with the presence of DSP except for stavudine, which had shown a statistical trend.CONCLUSION: The incidence of HIV-associated neuropathy in this group of Thai patients was higher than previous report. The most common pattern was distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, which was associated with low nadir CD4 cell counts.",

Among them, 118 children (11.2%) had genetic or syndromic conditions, of which 38 had Trisomy 21. Six subspecialty areas accounted for the vast majority of the cases: neurology (n = 140), pulmonology (n = 36), orthopaedics (n = 26), nephro-urology (n = 19), gastroenterology (n = 14) and endocrinology (n = 13). The most frequent associated conditions were mental retardation, asthma, epilepsy and scoliosis. During the study period, death occurred in 46 of the children (4.3%) and was not related to the cardiac disease in 20 cases (1.9%).CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of children with congenital heart disease have significant noncardiac comorbidities. Close collaboration between paediatric cardiologists and paediatricians of other subspecialties is imperative to optimize care for these children.",

The most serious diagnostic as well as therapeutic problems are psychotic disorders which coexist with epileptic seizures. The goal of this paper was to present the case history of a patient, who was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder caused by partial complex seizures. The patient presented was hospitalized many times and several different neuroleptic treatments were used unsuccessfully. During the course of the illness many severe episodes of psycho-motor agitation connected with auto-aggressive acts were observed. It was not until an EEG - Holter test was performed and antiepileptic drugs were added to the treatment which aided in making the correct diagnosis. This enabled the patient to return to his highest level of functioning since the onset of the illness.",

It might be increased by a potent radiosensitizer such as gemcitabine, which is believed to cross the disrupted blood-brain barrier. The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly gemcitabine given concurrently with WBRT.METHODS: Patients with BM from NSCLC were included. The dose of WBRT was 3750 cGy (total 15 times, 3 weeks). Gemcitabine was given concurrently with WBRT on days 1, 8 and 15. The starting dose was 400 mg/m(2), escalated by 100 mg/m(2) increments. At least three patients were included per level. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 4 hematological or grade 2 neurological toxicity. When two or more patients experience DLT, the MTD was reached.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were included; 69% had a performance status (PS) 1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG). A total of 69% had concurrent active extra cranial diseases. All had more than 3 BM. Up to 600 mg/m(2) (level 3) no neurology toxicity was observed. At 600 mg/m(2) two out of 9 patients developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia. One of the two patients' thrombocytopenia was confused with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). At 700 mg/m(2) two out of 4 patients developed neurotoxicities. One developed grade 3 seizure and cognitive disorder. Another patient developed suspected grade 2 muscle weakness.CONCLUSIONS: The MTD was reached at a dose of 700 mg/m(2). The dose of 600 mg/m(2) would be considered for further study.",

The intended audience is physicians and other emergency healthcare providers who treat patients within the first 48 hours after stroke. In addition, information for healthcare policy makers is included.METHODS: Members of the panel were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and represented different areas of expertise. The panel reviewed the relevant literature with an emphasis on reports published since 2003 and used the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Levels of Evidence grading algorithm to rate the evidence and to make recommendations. After approval of the statement by the panel, it underwent peer review and approval by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. It is intended that this guideline be fully updated in 3 years.RESULTS: Management of patients with acute ischemic stroke remains multifaceted and includes several aspects of care that have not been tested in clinical trials. This statement includes recommendations for management from the first contact by emergency medical services personnel through initial admission to the hospital. Intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator remains the most beneficial proven intervention for emergency treatment of stroke. Several interventions, including intra-arterial administration of thrombolytic agents and mechanical interventions, show promise. Because many of the recommendations are based on limited data, additional research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke is needed.",

We wanted to evaluate our daily practice and to confirm that the results obtained in the randomized clinical trials with rt-PA can be reproduced in routine practice.RESULTS: Among all stroke patients treated in the Neurology Department, 10.2 per cent were managed via this new pathway, in order to receive a fibrinolytic treatment. Amongst these, 25.6 per cent were treated with rt-PA (2.6 per cent of all ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, with an average NIHSS score of 15.8 at admission [5; 25]. In 90 per cent of the cases, potential patients for thrombolysis were selected by CT-scan. Time from onset to treatment averaged 2 h 25 min, whilst door-to-treatment time averaged 40 minutes. Two patients (3 percent) showed a symptomatic intra-cerebral hemorrhage. Death rate was 18.8 per cent. After 3 months, 53.5 per cent of patients were regarded as functionally \"independent\" (Rankin scale<3).CONCLUSION: These results in our unit confirm the feasibility, reproducibility, efficacy and safety of the rt-PA fibrinolytic treatment for ischemic stroke of less than 3 hours. A \"Stroke emergency\" pathway appears to be a helpful option to treat as many patients as possible with the shortest possible lead times.",

On the basis of Class II and III evidence, it is concluded that treatment of patients with MS with IFNbeta (Avonex, Betaseron, or Rebif) is associated with the production of NAbs (Level A). NAbs in the serum are probably associated with a reduction in the radiographic and clinical effectiveness of IFNbeta treatment (Level B). In addition, the rate of NAb production is probably less with IFNbeta-1a treatment than with IFNbeta-1b treatment, although the magnitude and persistence of this difference is difficult to determine (Level B). Finally, it is probable that there is a difference in seroprevalence due to variability in the dose of IFNbeta injected or in the frequency or route of its administration (Level B). Regardless of the explanation, it seems clear that IFNbeta-1a (as it is currently formulated for IM injection) is less immunogenic than the current IFNbeta preparations (either IFNbeta-1a or IFNbeta-1b) given multiple times per week subcutaneously (Level A). However, because NAbs disappear in some patients even with continued IFNbeta treatment (especially in patients with low titers), the persistence of this difference is difficult to determine (Level B). Although the finding of sustained high-titer NAbs (>100 to 200 NU/mL) is associated with a reduction in the therapeutic effects of IFNbeta on radiographic and clinical measures of MS disease activity, there is insufficient information on the utilization of NAb testing to provide specific recommendations regarding when to test, which test to use, how many tests are necessary, or which cutoff titer to apply (Level U).",

Although the definite etiology of ALS remains unclear, occupational or environmental exposures have been considered as one of the potential causes of ALS. Here, we report the case of a patient with ALS who used to work in a factory manufacturing electronic parts and has evidence of acute exposure to lead in excess. A 39-year-old man visited a neurology clinic with symptoms of progressive limb weakness and spasticity, which began 2 years ago. Upon neurological examination, symptoms of atrophy, spasticity and fasciculation of the lower extremities were evident. There were no signs of impairment of the cranial nerves, and cognitive and sensory functions were normal. Complete blood counts, blood chemistries and urinalysis were normal. Serial electromyography showed progressive denervative changes, which were consistent with motor neuron diseases. ALS was diagnosed according to the standard of the \"Diagnostic criteria of the World Federation of Neurology\". The patient was handling lead oxide (PbO) for development of positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermist, without being provided with proper respiratory protective equipment. Blood lead level of the patient was measured at 30.86 microg/dL 6 months after he quit his job. Bone lead levels from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were below the normal range (3 ppm). Blood lead level of his co-workers at the same workplace were above the ACGIH recommended biological exposure index (BEI: 30 microg/dL). We speculated that the ALS in this case was related to excessive exposure to lead.",

The frequency of nosocomial infection was 39.7%. UTI developed in 44.6%, while 27% had blood stream infection, and 21% had pneumonia. Each of the three major sites of infection was strongly associated with the use of invasive devices. Escherichia (E.) coli was the most common organism isolated followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella. E. coli and Klebsiella showed a maximum sensitivity to Imipenem followed by Tazocin (pipericillin + tazobactam). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to Amikacin and Fosfomycin.CONCLUSION: The high frequency of nosocomial infection suggests that more strict measures regarding invasive devices should be taken in future to control the infection and limit the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms.",

In Malaysia, a few electroencephalography facilities available in rural district hospitals run by trained physician assistants have Internet connections to a government neurological center in Kuala Lumpur. These facilities are more commonly available than MRI machines, which require radiological expertise and helium replacement, which may problematic in Southeast Asian countries where radiologists are found in mainly big cities or towns. We conducted a cross-sectional study over a two year period begining January 2001 on rural patients, correlating EEG reports and MRI images with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy to set guidelines for which rural patients need to be referred to a hospital with MRI facilities. The patients referred by different hospitals without neurological services were classified as having generalized, partial or unclassified seizures based on the International Classification of Epileptic Seizures proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The clinical parameters studied were seizure type, seizure frequency, status epilepticus and duration of seizure. EEG reports were reviewed for localized and generalized abnormalities and epileptiform changes. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression and area under the curve. The association between clinical and radiological abnormalities was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity. Twenty-six males and 18 females were evaluated. The mean age was 20.7 +/- 13.3 years. Nineteen (43.2%) had generalized seizures, 22 (50.0%) had partial seizures and 3 (6.8%) presented with unclassified seizures. The EEG was abnormal in 30 patients (20 with generalized abnormalities and 10 localized abnormalities). The MRI was abnormal in 17 patients (38.6%); the abnormalities observed were cerebral atrophy (5), hippocampal sclerosis (4), infarct/gliosis (3), cortical dysgenesis (2) and tumors (2). One patient had an arachnoid cyst in the right occipital region. Of the 17 patients with an abnormal MRI, 14 had an abnormal EEG, this difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant associaton between epileptographic changes and MRI findings (p = 0.078). EEG findings were associated with MRI findings (p = 0.004). The association between an abnormal EEG and an abnormal MRI had a specificity of 82.4%, while epileptogenic changes had a specificity of 64.7% in relation to abnormal MRI findings. This meants that those patients in rural hospitals with abnormal EEGs should be referred to a neurology center for further workup and an MRI to detect causes with an epileptic focus.",

The purpose of the study was to estimate the number and type of falls and fall-related injuries in patients of a neurological rehabilitation ward and to identify risk factors for falls.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 353 consecutive post-stroke patients of the Neurorehabilitation Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw were enrolled into the study and observed during the hospital stay. Falls occurring in patients during their hospital stay were registered and an analysis of fall-related data and the routinely obtained medical data was performed.RESULTS: In the evaluated group, 35 (10%) patients suffered 50 falls, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 5.02 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 3.70-6.52] falls per 1000 patient-days. Most falls occurred in patients' rooms (80%), most of them taking place while transferring from one place to another or while changing position. 2% of falls caused severe injury. There was a higher percentage of patients with unilateral neglect in the group of fallers (p=0.0007), who also demonstrated poorer performance in activities of daily living as expressed by the Rankin score (p <0.0002) and the Barthel Index (p <0.0001), and greater neurological deficit in the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) (p=0.002) at admission as well as at discharge from hospital than non-fallers. The risk of a fall showed greatest association with low Barthel Index at admission (<15/20; RR=10.3; 95% CI: 2.8-50.7), performance in the Rankin score of >3 (RR=5.12; 95% CI: 2,41-14,8), low SSS score on admission (0-39; RR=3.40; 95% CI: 1.62-9.14), and the presence of hemispatial neglect (RR=3.42; 95% CI: 1.23-6.53). The multiple-fallers group did not differ significantly from the group of single-fallers.CONCLUSIONS: Among post-stroke patients, falls are a complication especially affecting persons with a large neurological deficit, severe disability and the neglect syndrome.",

The aim of the present study was to provide a prospective, longitudinal investigation into cognitive function in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with either neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling.METHODS: Twenty-three patients who were treated for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, England, were recruited prospectively. Twelve patients who underwent surgical clipping were compared with a group of 11 patients who underwent endovascular coiling. All patients underwent a comprehensive, standardized neuropsychological assessment using the same battery of tests at the acute stage (within 2 wk after treatment). All patients who underwent coiling and 11 of the 12 patients who underwent clipping were reassessed at the post-acute long-term follow-up (6 mo) stage.RESULTS: Group comparisons at the acute assessment revealed a significant difference favoring coiling patients on only one measure of verbal recall. However, there were no other significant differences between the groups at this stage. At the post-acute assessment, the clipped group performed better than the coiled group on measures of intellectual functioning (P < 0.05), although no other differences were found on a range of cognitive tests. Intragroup comparisons between the acute and post-acute assessments found equivocal, significant improvements in measures of intellectual functioning, memory, executive functions, and speed of information processing in both groups of patients.CONCLUSION: We argue that there are minimal differences in the long-term cognitive outcome between endovascular coiling and surgical clipping. In the acute phase after treatment, we suggest that coiled patients, having been spared neurosurgical intervention, may have a slightly better cognitive outcome than clipped patients. However, these differences level off and both groups of patients ultimately experience widespread improvement in cognitive functioning by the post-acute stage of recovery.",

However, possible methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cross-infection by way of faces has not yet been properly examined.METHODS: One hundred and seventy-eight isolates from 159 inpatients from February 1999 to January 2000 were subjected to chromosomal DNA analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).RESULTS: The 178 MRSA isolates were classified into 43 PFGE types. Cross-infection was more frequent in the Department of Neurology [average number of patients per PFGE pattern (n/PFGE) = 4.0] than in the other six nonsurgical departments (n/PFGE = 1.0-1.6), and more frequent in four surgical departments (n/PFGE = 2.0-4.5) than in the other eight (n/PFGE = 1.0-1.7). In neurology, patients' faces were more often touched for examination of the cranial nerves than in the other departments. In the above four surgical departments, organs in the face were chiefly operated upon, and the patients' faces were also touched for care before and after the operation.CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the possibility of MRSA being transmitted by way of patients' faces in a hospital.",

T2 hyperintense lesion load, black hole lesion load, presence of contrast-enhancing lesions, and normalized brain volume were derived from the baseline magnetic resonance imaging and considered as possible explanatory variables for the subsequent annualized percentage of brain volume change (PBVC/y) using forward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis.SETTING: MS center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Patients Eighty-nine patients recently diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis were included at the time of diagnosis from our outpatient clinic. Main Outcome Measure Annualized percentage of brain volume change.RESULTS: The mean (SD) annualized rate of cerebral atrophy was -0.9 (0.8) PBVC/y. Baseline normalized brain volume (standardized coefficient, 0.426; P = .001) and baseline T2 lesion load (standardized coefficient, -0.244; P = .02) were identified as explanatory variables for subsequent PBVC/y and yielded a regression model that explained 31.2% of the variance in PBVC/y.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recently diagnosed multiple sclerosis, the extent of accumulated brain tissue loss and overall lesion load partly explain the subsequent rate of cerebral atrophy.",

We also investigated the response to several treatment modalities. The aim was to reveal the clinical spectrum of the disease; the diagnostic criteria developed by the Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in 1991 were used. The subjects consisted of 17 men (68%) and eight women (32%) aged 18-81 years (mean age: 48.5 years) with CIDP. Eighteen patients (72%) had a symmetric neuropathy, whereas seven (28%) had an asymmetric neuropathy. Two patients (8%) had a pure sensory neuropathy. Nine (36%) presented with cranial nerve involvement and only one (4%) had central nervous system demyelination. Most patients had a satisfactory response after treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plasma exchange and azathioprine. In conclusion, CIDP is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. It is one of the few serious chronic neuropathies that has a good (although not permanent) treatment response.",

The two groups were age-matched with a mean age of 5.8 years. In the amblyopia group, five children had strabismus amblyopia, and eight had anisometropic amblyopia. We analyzed the original 3-dimensional T1 brain images using the VBM module within the widely used analysis software package SPM2 (Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom). After normalization, segmentation, and smoothing of the images, comparison between amblyopic and control groups was derived for the gray matter of the entire brain using parametric statistics.RESULTS: The results of VBM analysis indicated that the amblyopic group had decreased gray matter density in the middle frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus of the left hemisphere, and the bilateral calcarine cortices. The radii of these regions ranged from 12 to 36 voxels. These abnormalities were consistent with morphologic changes in brain regions related to visual function.CONCLUSIONS: Using MR and VBM analysis, we detected morphologic changes in the visual cortex of children with amblyopia, which may indicate developmental abnormalities of visual cortex during the critical growth period.",

Clinical records of 53 consecutive patients (27 stroke or TIA and 26 other diseases) discharged from our general neurology department were coded by four neurology residents, four general neurologists and four neurologists trained in ICD-coding (experts). Inter-coder agreement was evaluated by the kappa statistic. The overall kappa value for coding 430-438 was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.70-0.84) for primary (PDx) and 0.82 (0.77-0.88) for PDx+secondary diagnoses (SDx). It was 0.73-0.86 for the residents, 0.78-0.90 for the neurologists and 0.67-0.88 for the experts. The overall kappa values (PDx, SDx) for specific codes were 0.83-0.88 for 431-intracerebral haemorrhage (residents: 0.75-0.89; neurologists: 0.91-0.96; experts: 0.78-0.88) and 0.48-0.51 for 434-occlusion of cerebral arteries) (residents: 0.26-0.26; neurologists: 0.61-0.66; experts: 0.60-0.65). Agreement was substantial for the whole code group 430-438 and higher for code 431 than 434. Reliability was generally improved when both PDx and SDx were considered. Specific training did not increase inter-coders' agreement.",

First, research findings were compiled into evidence tables focusing on different clinical issues. Second, an advisory panel of clinicians, educational and public health experts, and families of children with epilepsy reviewed the evidence. The advisory group used the evidence to draft a preliminary set of performance indicators for pediatric epilepsy management. Third, 13 internationally recognized experts in pediatric neurology or epilepsy rated the value of these indicators on a 5-point scale [1 (essential) to 5 (not necessary)] in a two-round Delphi process. Positive consensus was reached if >or=80% of experts gave an indicator a \"1\" rating and negative consensus if >80% gave an indicator a \"5\" rating. Indicators that achieved positive consensus during either round of the Delphi process constituted the final set of indicators.RESULTS: Of the 68 draft performance indicators, the expert panel members achieved positive consensus on 30 performance indicators: eight indicators related to diagnostic strategies and seizure classification, nine related to antiepileptic drug use, six related to cognitive and behavioral issues, six related to quality of life, and three related to specialty referrals.CONCLUSIONS: We identified 30 potential indicators for evaluating the care provided to pediatric patients with epilepsy. The next step is to examine the relation of these performance indicators to clinical outcomes and health care utilization among pediatric patients with epilepsy.",

To determine whether elevation of FVIII and VWF is more frequent in CSVT, we analysed plasma levels of FVIII and VWF in a case control study.METHODS: The study population consisted of 25 consecutive patients (of whom nine were excluded) admitted for CSVT to the Department of Neurology, Amiens University Hospital, France, from January 1997 to December 2002, for a general screening for thrombophilia. Sixty-four healthy subjects matched for age and sex formed the group control.RESULTS: Mean FVIII (CSVT: 167.3 (SD 48.8) IU/dl; control group: 117.9 (39.8) IU/dl; p = 0.001) and VWF levels (CSVT: 165.4 (76.5)%; control group: 108.5 (27.8)%; p = 0.01) were significantly higher in the CSVT group. Using the 95th percentile of the control group as the cut off value, elevated FVIII (>190 IU/dl) occurred in 25% (4/16) (p = 0.005) and elevated VWF (>168%) in 37.5% (6/16) of patients with CSVT (p<0.001). Using previously reported cut off values (>150 IU/dl or >150%) showed the same results (FVIII: p = 0.005; VWF: p = 0.009).CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that elevation of plasma factor VIII levels is the most common prothrombotic risk factor for CSVT. Elevation of VWF is also associated with an increased risk of CSVT but its effect seems to be partly mediated through FVIII.",

The dental status of our 33 years old patient with Wilson-syndrome showed the same situation. The Wilson-syndrome is a hepatolenticular degeneration, with the disfunction of copper excretion in liver. Toxic dose of copper is accumulated in liver, in the nuclei of central nerve system, in kidneys, and in cornea. Deficiency of coeruloplasmin characterizes the disease which might occur in a form of acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatosplenomegaly without any symptom. Initial symptoms might usually be extrahepatic, with the presence of the green and golden brown Kayser-Fleischer copper deposition. Treatment is necessary until the end of life, 1 g Penicillamine/ day. Our patient with Wilson-syndrome has been treated for 17 years at the Department of Neurology Semmelweis University. Dystonia, speech disorder, and intention tremor are rampant among his symptoms. At the time of admittance to dental clinic, both the upper and lower dental arches belonged to class 2B according to the F?bi?n and Fej?rdy classification of partial edentulousness. After root canal fillings and cementation of dowel cores, an upper and lower fix and removable partial denture combination was made. Oral hygiene was controlled every three months. Dentures are worn for half a year without complaint.",

Panels were asked to select items from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) reflecting relevant disease-specific health problems. Items appraised as relevant by the panel members were compared with items in established measures namely: the Minimal Record of Disability (MRD) and the Disability and Impact Profile (DIP).RESULTS: Sixty-eight ICF items were considered to be the most relevant, and belonged to four ICF domains. No significant differences were found between the appraisal of items by patients/proxies and health professionals. Agreement across the disease panels appeared to be (very) strong. Differences between the three disease-specific panels were found for the 'Body Functions and Structures' domain: consensus was reached by extension of the inclusion criteria. The ICF-item selection covers almost all items of the established measures. The largest contrast was shown in the item selection for the 'participation' and 'environmental factors' domains.CONCLUSIONS: Selected items indicate a broader scope in studying health problems compared with widely used health status measures in neurology, especially for the ICF domains 'Participation' and 'Environmental Factors'.",

Three quarter of the patients become seizure free, however the remaining patients experience seizures after resection. In our study we analyzed retrospectively the possible electro-clinical, neuroimaging and surgery-related outcome predictors in 94 adult patients who had anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) from the material of Epilepsy Centre of the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Budapest since the beginning of the surgery program in 1989 until 2001. Three outcome endpoints were chosen: the seizure status at the last visit, the longest seizure free period and the time to the first non-acute postoperative seizure. The predictors were assessed by multivariate and Cox regression methods. After one year of surgery 72% of the patients were seizure free, after two years 67% and after five years 59%. Factors predicting favorable outcome in TLE surgery were: typical temporomesial aura, strictly unilateral interictal anterotemporal spikes, unilateral ictal onset, slow contralateral propagation, hippocampal sclerosis (HS) as etiology. Factors predicting poor outcome in TLE surgery were: increase in seizure frequency in the last two preoperative years, presence of preoperative psychiatric disturbances, ictal contralateral propagation, MRI lesion distant from the surgery site, incongruency of data of preoperative investigations, postoperative sequels and non-HS type MR residuum.",

We have recently shown that the novel micellar magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent gadofluorine M (Gf) accumulates in nerve fibers undergoing Wallerian degeneration. In the present study, we report on the in vivo visualization of focal demyelination induced by lysolecithin. Upon appropriate intraneural injection, lysolecithin focally dissolves myelin sheaths with sparing of axons. Conventional unenhanced and gadolinium-DTPA enhanced T1-w MRI did not show signal alterations or contrast enhancement. In contrast, application of Gf led to bright contrast enhancement on T1-w images at the site of focal demyelination, but spared distal nerve segments not affected by demyelination. Gf enhancement persisted until remyelination had occurred. Our study shows that areas of focal nerve demyelination can be detected in vivo by Gf-enhanced MRI. This finding opens up a broad spectrum of applications in experimental neurology, and, depending on further clinical development of Gf, may aid in the diagnostic work up of patients with patchy, multifocal demyelinative disorders in the future.",

C. jejuni specific antibodies (CAs) were measured in 420 blood donors (controls), 99 patients with recent C. jejuni infection, 34 patients with central nervous system disorders (neurology controls), and 44 patients with peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorders: 18 with GBS, 12 with MND and 14 with chronic inflammatory neuropathies. Elevated CA titres consistent with recent C. jejuni infection were found in six of the 44 patients with PNS disorders (three with GBS, two with neuropathy, and one with MND, only one of whom had a history of recent C. jejuni infection), compared with two of 454 controls (p = 0.00001). Therefore, we conclude that CAs are often raised in patients with PNS disorders who do not have a history of recent C. jejuni gastroenteritis, so Campylobacter serology may be an unreliable marker of recent infection in this patient group.",

Although demyelination is regarded as the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of MMN, recently, it was reported that different pathophysiologic mechanisms were responsible for disease in the upper and lower limbs. Specifically, demyelination in the upper limbs and axonal loss in the lower limbs. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to assess, through clinical neurophysiology studies, whether different pathophysiologic mechanisms were occurring in the upper and lower extremities. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether the presence of conduction block (CB) correlated with axonal degeneration (AD), and to determine the electrophysiological abnormalities that correlate with muscle weakness.METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 18 patients with MMN for clinical features (using the Medical Research Council score and Guys Neurology Disability Scale) and neurophysiologic abnormalities (CB, AD prolongation of distal motor and F-wave latencies, and reduction of conduction velocity in the demyelinating range).RESULTS: Electrophysiological abnormalities deemed specific of demyelination were non-significantly different in the upper and lower extremities. The presence of axonal degeneration correlated significantly with conduction block (odds ratio 10.4, 95% CI 4.2-25.6), and both parameters correlated with muscle weakness (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the same pathophysiologic process occurs in the upper and lower extremity nerves. Moreover, one pathophysiologic process may be responsible for the development of CB and AD, and therefore muscle weakness.SIGNIFICANCE: The present study has established that both AD and CB occur in MMN, irrespective of extremity, and both correlate with muscle weakness.",

The purpose of this study was 1) to clarify characteristics of very mild AD and MCI in their daily life, and 2) to examine items in a questionnaire that can be useful for detecting subjects of suspected AD.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 111 patients of the memory clinic in National Center Hospital for Mental, Nervous, and Muscular Disorders, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Japan; 39 normal range, 28 MCI, and 44 very mild AD. On their first visits, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire consisted of 103 items. Thirty five items in a questionnaire were selected, 15 memory-complaint items and 20 items of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and examined retrospectively. At first we compared each set of groups using the chi-square test. Then a logistic regression analysis was used to observe which items contributed to judge a person to be suspected of AD. And further, sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between an AD suspected and a normal range were examined.RESULTS: None of the items showed statistical significance between MCI group and very mild AD group. Then, we combined these two groups into one group (n = 72), and made comparison between this new group and normal range group (n = 39). There were 18 items that showed statistical significance between the two groups. And five of them, 'dysfunction of memory: noticed by others', 'dysfunction of memory: getting worse', 'unable to utilize the memorandum', 'forget incidents occurred a few days ago' and 'unable to locate unfamiliar places' showed significantly high odds ratio in judgment on a person to be suspected of AD. In addition to preceding 5 items we adopted two items, 'dysfunction of memory: unnoticeable by her/himself' and 'unable to manage household expenses', which were not included in the logistic regression analysis, but were essential for the discrimination between the two groups. The sum of score of these 7 items showed high specificity and sensitivity for dividing between the two groups.CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that an exploration of memory complaints and deteriorations of IADL was useful for the detection of MCI and very mild AD, especially 7 items described above could be used as a simple questionnaire for the elderly.",

Its prevalence doubled as patients began to live longer after the introduction of highly active retroviral therapy. Women are now one of the fastest growing groups with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States and Puerto Rico, but relatively little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of cognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected women. In this study the authors investigated its prevalence in a group of HIV-1-seropositive Hispanic women in Puerto Rico. Forty-nine women with a nadir CD4 cell count of < or = 500 cells/mm3 were enrolled. Cognitive impairment was defined according to the American Academy of Neurology criteria for HIV dementia as modified to identify an \"asymptomatic cognitively impaired\" group. Observed prevalence was compared with prevalence in other populations in United States, Europe, and Australia. Differences in clinical markers and neuropsychological test performance among the cohort stratified by cognitive impairment were tested. Cognitive impairment was observed in 77.6% (38/49) of cases; asymptomatic cognitive impairment in 32.7% (16/49); minor cognitive motor disorders in 16.3% (8/49); and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in 28.6% (14/49). Cognitive impairment did not correlate with age, CD4 cell count, viral load, or treatment modality. The cross-sectional prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment was 77.6% (28.6% for HAD). These findings should enhance awareness of the prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment, both clinically apparent and \"asymptomatic,\" in Hispanic women and lead to improvements in areas such as education and compliance and to reevaluation of treatment interventions.",

In this study 836 patients were analyzed with a first-ever stroke admitted at the Department of Neurology Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, from January 1(st) 1997 to December 31(st) 1998. Of these 613 (73,3%) were ischemic strokes and 223 intracerebral hemorrhages (26,7%) Subarachnoid hemorrhages were excluded. After hospitalization surviving patients examined periodically, and a final examination was performed 5 years after the stroke. Overall, case-fatility at the first month was 36% (301/836) and the mortality rate was significantly higher in the patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (58,3% vs. 27,9%, p<0,0001). The first year survived 60% patients with ischemic stroke, and 38% with intracerebral hemorrhage. After 5 years, 188 (31%) patients with ischemic stroke and 53 (24%) with intracerebral hemorrhage were alive (p=0,5), and the cumulative survival rate for the entire study was 29%. Among 30-day survivors (n=535) surviving rate after 5 years was significantly higher in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (57% vs. 42,5%, p=0,01). The survival rate was the highest for those 50 years and younger (57%), and the lowest for those aged over 70 years (9%). Predictors of 5-year mortality were older age and hypertension for both types of stroke, heart diseases for ischemic stroke and diabetes for intracerebral hemorrhage. Long-term survival after first-ever ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage is similar. However, among 30-day survivors the 5-year survival is better in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.",

Tests were done by physiotherapists and occupational therapists who were members of rehabilitation team. Our aim was to select the tests which can be used as a routine and are applicable for different neurological impairments in daily work. Tests were applied to inpatients admitted to the Medical, Trauma, Neurology and Neurosurgery wards in the Rashid Hospital, DOHMS, Dubai. Fifty inpatients with different neurological impairments admitted to totally 8 wards, were tested in the beginning of rehabilitation process and on discharge from the hospital. Nine tests were used as standardized tests for measuring motor, cognitive, focal impairment, ADL activities and disability: Motricity Index, Trunk Control Test, Standing Balance score, Functional Ambulation Categories test, Mini Mental State Examination, Canadian Neurological Scale, Action Research Arm test, Bartel Index and Functional Independent Measurements. FIM, Motricity Index and Trunk Control Test were applicable for all tested patients, with required adaptation for different neurological conditions within the same score. Other tests were not applicable for all patients as routine, but there were very useful for certain number of patients as a measurement of functional improvement. It is very important to have proper setup of tests, which are simple, reliable and valid for measuring impairment, disability and handicap and which can be used as standardized part of assessment protocol. Also, they must be applicable for different neurological impairments to monitor treatment progress. Combination of tests performed by different professionals and comprehensive approach of all team members is very important for measuring outcomes in rehabilitation and evaluating patient's impairment and disability. Proper hospital setup, optimal number of staff, good communication and team work are leading to better outcome in neurorehabilitation process.",

All cases of mortality were reviewed in detail.RESULTS: The majority of patients (98%) survived their admission; 118 patients died. In 95/118 cases, care had been withdrawn at the time of death. In 11 cases, adverse events occurred during the patients' hospital stay and may have impacted outcome. Few patients (18%) had clear advance directives.CONCLUSION: Most mortality in this acute care neurology setting occurs in the course of stroke, epilepsy, or complicated tumor management and is managed through withdrawal of care with family participation.",

OXC is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED), and the occurrence of reproductive dysfunction in women treated with OXC monotherapy for epilepsy has not been studied previously.METHODS: Thirty-five women with epilepsy were examined in the Department of Neurology at Oulu University Hospital. Sixteen patients were treated with CBZ monotherapy, and nineteen patients were treated with OXC monotherapy. The subjects were clinically examined, vaginal ultrasonography was performed, and serum sex hormone concentrations were measured.RESULTS: The women taking CBZ or OXC had lower serum testosterone (T) levels and lower free androgen indexes (FAIs) than the control subjects. CBZ medication was associated with increased concentrations of serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). The patients taking OXC had higher concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstendione (A) than did the women taking CBZ. Moreover, the prevalence of polycystic ovaries (PCOs) was high in the OXC-treated women.CONCLUSIONS: CBZ and OXC have different effects on the reproductive endocrine function. Although both drugs were associated with low serum T concentrations and low FAIs, only OXC was associated with a high frequency of elevated levels of A and DHEAS and with an increased prevalence of PCOs. These findings suggest that OXC may be disadvantageous for women with epilepsy and hyperandrogenism, whereas CBZ may be beneficial for these women.",

Patients eligible for the study were those with migraine, above 14 years of age, who needed preventive treatment and in whom other preventive treatments had failed or for whom topiramate was believed to be the most suitable therapy as regards its profile of side effects. The effectiveness of the treatment, patient satisfaction, side effects and loss of body weight were all evaluated. Effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by means of the reduction in the frequency of migraines and the score obtained on the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6).RESULTS: A total of 79 patients were evaluated. The dosage of topiramate ranged between 25 and 200 mg/day, with an average of 100 mg/day. 19% of the patients dropped out of the study due to side effects. Paresthesias were the most frequent reason for dropping out. No serious side effects were observed. 14% of the patients lost more than 5% of the base weight. The percentage of patients who responded was 58%. The degree of satisfaction of the patients who completed the follow-up was: good (80%), regular (11%) and poor (9%).CONCLUSIONS: Preventive treatment with topiramate significantly reduces the impact of migraine and the disability that results from it. Treatment is satisfactory and improves the quality of life in a large percentage of patients.",

Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared with reports of patients from either Western or Asian origin; the long-term disability score was analyzed according to gender, age of onset of MS and the initial symptom.RESULTS: The clinical expression of MS in Mexican Mestizos shares some characteristics with both, Asian and Western forms of MS indicating that the genetic composition of Mexican Mestizos participates in the clinical expression of the disease. Also, at the prevalence date, the mean age of patients and the duration of the disease were lower in our patients than in MS patients from endemic countries suggesting a true increasing incidence in recent times, rather than only improved case ascertainment.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical expression of MS in Mexican Mestizos shows the coexistence of some features common in European and in Asian cases.",

The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of Sotos syndrome in a consecutive series of patients with global developmental delay, which might modify our laboratory evaluation approach to this particular clinical situation. For a 10-year inclusive interval, the case records of all consecutive patients referred for global developmental delay in a single pediatric neurology practice were reviewed. Patients with macrocephaly were defined by an age- and gender-adjusted head circumference greater than or equal to the 98th percentile. Possible clinical factors associated with eventual diagnosis of Sotos syndrome in this group of macrocephalic children were tested with a two-tailed Fisher exact test. Of 261 children with global developmental delay, 18 (7%) had documented macrocephaly. Of these 18 children, 3 (17%) had an advanced bone age and were diagnosed with Sotos syndrome. In patients with global developmental delay and concomitant macrocephaly, Sotos syndrome is not uncommon. Assessment of bone age is a simple screening test for diagnosis of this entity and should be undertaken routinely in children with macrocephaly and global developmental delay even in the absence of other distinctive syndromic clinical features.",

      "abstractText": "PURPOSE: Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures (NES) are termed \"nonepileptic psychogenic seizures\" and account for approximately 20% of all intractable seizure disorders. These seizures are often misdiagnosed as true epilepsy, resulting in inappropriate, ineffective and costly treatment of many patients. Nowadays video-EEG monitoring have greatly improved the ability of specialists to correctly distinguish NES from epilepsy. Nevertheless, patients with NES do not always demonstrate obvious psychopathology. The aim of this study is to examine the complexity and severity of psychopathological features of patients with NES, in order to optimize strategies of intervention and appropriate long-term psychological and psychopharmacological treatment for these patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated three samples: patients with NES, patients with epilepsy and a control sample. Subjects with pseudoseizures and epileptic seizures have been randomly recruited from the Epilepsy Centre at the Neurology Institute of Catholic University of Sacred Heart of Rome. Seizures have been documented by the recording of spontaneous events with video-EEG, EEG, clinical observation and ictal examination. Each sample of patients has been tested using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS), Dissociative Experience Scale (DES), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) and Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36).RESULTS: 17 (4 M; 13 F) patients with NES, 13 (3 M; 10 F) patients with epilepsy and 16 (4 M; 12 F) control subjects were recruited. Our preliminary results confirm previous researches showing that NES typically manifest between 20 and 30 years of age and that approximately a three-quarters of all patients are women. Besides, they confirm that psychosocial, environmental and intrapsychic mechanisms interact in the aetiology of NES: in particular, our preliminary results are consistent with the hypothesis that traumatic experiences are important precursors to the development and expression of NES.CONCLUSIONS: This study has yielded promising results and confirm the necessity to improve our knowledge about psychopathology of patients with NES. Psychiatrists and neurologists should work in equipe to guarantee an adequate treatment for a pathology too long set aside and almost ignored from clinical research.",

Most of the cases have been published on a case report basis, and there is not a general agreement about the best way of treatment.METHODS: In this work, we analyze our experience with 5 cases of TN secondary to a posterior fossa AVM, treated at the Division of Neurosurgery from the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, \"Manuel Velasco Suarez,\" Mexico City, Mexico, from January 1985 to December 2004.RESULTS: Trigeminal neuralgia associated with an AVM occurred in 1.3% of 375 brain AVMs and 9.8% of 37 posterior fossa AVMs. All had received drug therapy unsuccessfully, and 2 of them underwent a percutaneous thermocoagulation without solving the neuralgia. In 4 patients, a microvascular decompression was completed with excellent results.CONCLUSIONS: Even when different ways of treatment have been reported, it seems that percutaneous procedures (glycerol injection, thermocoagulation, or microcompression of the gasserian ganglia) give variable clinical results. The reported experience and our own results support the microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve as the best treatment whenever the total excision of the AVM cannot be accomplished.",

Patients with UTI before catheterization and in whom the catheter was removed before one week were excluded. Urine cultures were done immediately after catheterization and 3 times a week there after. Patients were followed for symptoms of UTI for 1 week after catheter removal, for 4 weeks without evidence of UTI or until discharge.RESULTS: One hundred and one patients met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of CA UTI was 73.3%. High incidence of CAUTI was found in the first 2 weeks after catheterization. About one-half of the patients with CAUTI had a single episode and were symptomatic. None of the 132 episodes of CAUTI were associated with secondary bacteremia. Risk factors for CAUTI identified were prolonged catheterization and change of the catheter Nosocomial pathogens were found in urine and yeast was the commonest. Eleven patients (14.9%) with CAUTI died and only in 2, CAUTI was considered a contributory factor for mortality. The cost of antimicrobials for treating one episode of CAUTI was 8,180 baht and this rose to 49,983 baht for CAUTI associated with concurrent infections at other sites.CONCLUSION: Catheter-associated urinary tract infection was common. Uropathogens were nosocomial micro-organisms with high incidence of resistance to antimicrobials. Impacts on morbidity, mortality and costs were substantial. Better management of urinary catheter is to be explored and implemented.",

The charge was imposed in response to the significant controversy surrounding questions relating to the optimal management strategies for patients with single brain metastasis.METHODS: A team consisting of physicians from the AANS, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American Association of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology convened and the literature was reviewed. Methodically drawing from the best of Class I, II, and III levels of available evidence, authors sought to determine how the literature addressed and disposed of the question of the optimal management for an adult with a known history of cancer and a single metastatic brain lesion. Framing the question in this specific manner allowed researchers to focus directly on treatment issues, without having to consider diagnostic issues.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the evidence-based analysis demonstrated that there was insufficient information to establish standards of care. Data from the literature does, however, support a guideline stating that surgical resection accompanied by whole brain radiation therapy is associated with the best survival rate. Additional lower-quality evidence supports an option for management with radiosurgery.",

Despite improvements in perinatal practice during the past several decades, the incidence of cerebral palsy attributed to intrapartum asphyxia has remained essentially unchanged, primarily because management strategies were supportive and not targeted toward the processes of ongoing injury. Two processes of neuronal injury can be demonstrated after hypoxia-ischemia: neuronal necrosis and apoptosis. Because the mechanisms of these processes likely differ, strategies to minimize brain damage in an affected infant after hypoxia-ischemia likely will have to include interventions that target both processes. The goals of management of a newborn infant who has sustained a hypoxic-ischemic insult and is at risk for evolving injury should include (1) early identification of the infant at highest risk for evolving to the syndrome of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, (2) supportive care to facilitate adequate perfusion and nutrients to the brain, and (3) consideration of interventions to ameliorate the processes of ongoing brain injury. Although the neurology group was unable to develop a definitive framework for the study of neuroprotective strategies for neonatal encephalopathy, it (1) listed key questions to be addressed before exploring possible study designs for managing hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonates, (2) identified important study-design issues, (3) determined general principles and key elements for neuroprotective-treatment strategies, (4) identified potential treatment strategies, (5) proposed a clinical-trial framework, and (6) identified key elements for a potential clinical-trial framework comparing hypothermia with hypothermia \"plus\" for moderate-to-severe encephalopathy.",

      "abstractText": "INTRODUCTION: Today it is certain that dementia is caused by a disease and not by ageing. The field is within the neurological, psychiatric and geriatric subject areas. In the city of Copenhagen, discovery and treatment of dementia occur on three levels: (1) in general practice, (2) in local memory clinics headed by specialists in geriatrics, neurology and/or psychiatry, and (3) in the memory clinic at H:S Rigshospitalet. In 2000, the geriatric clinic at H:S Bispebjerg Hospital established a local memory clinic. The fact that the clinic was created within a basic speciality other than neurology, as at Rigshospitalet, made it necessary to carry out developmental work.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive evaluation of 450 consecutive patient courses was performed. The patients were evaluated and treated in the memory unit in the period from 14 March 2001 to 31 December 2004.RESULTS: 330 (73%) of the 450 patients were women, and 120 (27%) were men. The median age was 84 years (range 64-97 years), and the median MMSE score was 24 (range 1-30) at first consultation in the memory unit. A cerebral CT was done on 339 patients (75%), and a SPECT scan was done on 6 patients (1%). 90 patients (20%) were evaluated by a gerontopsychiatrist during the treatment course, and 151 patients (34%) were evaluated by a neuropsychologist. A diagnosis of irreversible dementia was made for 322 patients (72%).CONCLUSION: Most of the patients referred had a MMSE score greater than 20, and even patients with very high MMSE scores may suffer from irreversible dementia. Compared with examinations in Danish memory clinics in the context of neurology, there was a higher number of patients with irreversible dementia. The difference may probably be explained by the average age difference between the patients referred. The threshold of referring for evaluation of cognitive dysfunction may be lower for younger patients than for older patients. The geriatric concept is an appropriate platform for evaluation and treatment of older patients with cognitive dysfunction before such patients are hospitalized on an emergency basis or break down socially. To carry out complete and qualified evaluation and treatment, it is essential to establish local and close cooperation with a gerontopsychiatrist, a neurologist and a neuropsychologist.",

We posited that changes in gene expression induced by ambient hypoxia at altitude may be neuroprotective to natives of these regions. We studied 30 men. Twenty natives of Cerro de Pasco (CP), altitude 4,338 m were examined in CP; then transported within 6 h to Lima (150 m-sea level) and examined 1 h after arrival. They were assessed by a Chronic Mountain Sickness-score (CMS-sc) in CP, 10 were normal Andeans and 10 had chronic mountain sickness (CMS), a sudden inexplicable loss of adaptation to their native environment. RNA was extracted from venous blood white cells. The Andeans were compared to 10 normal US men living at 1500 m using RT-PCR. We focused on the cyto-neuro-protective genes, Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), heme-oxygenase-1 (HMOX 1), heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70), heat shock protein-90 (HSP-90), and the neuroprotective enzyme, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 1 (Nnmat 1). CMS patients had significantly higher levels of gene expression (HMOX-1, HSP-70, ATM) than Andean controls in CP. HSP-90 and Nmnat 1, however, were higher in Andean controls in all locations. Significant reductions of all gene products, within an hour of arriving in normoxia in Lima, were found. In Andean controls, the gene products in Lima fell to levels approaching US controls. Correlation and regression methods showed men with high expression of all gene products had an average CMS-sc=19.8; those with low expression a normal score (9.4, P=0.02). ATM expression was related to age (P<0.001). The natural experiment that unfolds in the mountainous regions of the world provides opportunities to study neuroprotection in intact humans.",

Twenty chronic headache patients in a nontreatment control period were provided appliance and self-management therapies, evaluated five weeks after therapy, and those who chose to continue using their appliances were evaluated three months later. The mean pretreatment Headache Disability Inventory (HDI) score of 64.5 suggested the headaches were severe. After five weeks, the mean HDI score decreased by 17 percent (p<0.003), headache medication consumption dropped by 18 percent (p<0.0001), and headache symptoms decreased by 19 percent (p<0.002). Comparing the three months with pretreatment follow-up, the fourteen participants who chose to continue using their appliances had a mean HDI score decrease of 23 percent (p<0.003), headache medication consumption drop of 46 percent (p<0.001), and headache symptom decrease of 39 percent (p<0.001). There was no correlation between response and headache type (p=0.722). These results suggest appliance and self-management therapies can be beneficial for many severe headache patients, irrespective of the headache type (tension-type, migraine without aura, and migraine with aura).",

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of chronic use of phenytoin, carbamazepine or valproate monotherapy on the plasma levels of folate and B(12), and to compare folate and B(12) levels in epileptic patients with or without cardiovasular disorders.METHODS: The study was conducted in the outpatient neurology clinic at Bahrain Defence Force (BDF) Hospital between January-July, 2005. Medical information was obtained by interviewing the patients and examining their hospital records. Blood folate and vitamin B(12) were measured by Immulite immunoanalysis assay using chemoluminescence.RESULTS: A total of 26 consecutive outpatients (17 males, 9 females) were recruited in the study. Their mean age +/- SD was 38.2 +/- 20.1 year (range 15-77 year). Five (19.2%) had complex partial epilepsy and the remainder had tonic-clonic seizures. They had epilepsy for 15.7 +/- 8.1 years (range 2-35 years). Thirteen of them used phenytoin, nine carbamazepine and four used valproate. The duration of the treatment (years), dose (mg/day) and serum concentration (micromol/l) were 18.3 +/- 10.6, 376.9 +/- 180.4, 41.6 +/- 25.6, for phenytoin, 14.5 +/- 11.7, 422.2 +/- 175.0, 31.1 +/- 15.9 for carbamazepine and 18.3 +/- 6.3, 400, 567.7 +/- 78.1 for valproate, respectively. Eleven (42.3%) had established cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, myocardial infarction or stroke. The mean level of plasma folate (12.94 +/- 6.76 ng/ml) and B12 (484.94 +/- 191.25 pg/ml) in epileptic patients with cardiovascular disorders compared to their values (11.27 +/- 5.84), (514.49 +/- 225.31) respectively in epileptics with no cardiovascular disorders were not statistically significant in the two groups.CONCLUSION: In epileptic patients on chronic therapy with phenytoin, carbamazepine or valproate folate and B(12) levels were not different in patients with or without cardiovascular disorders.",

We aimed to create a rapid yet accurate screening instrument for major depression in people with epilepsy.METHODS: We developed a set of 46 items to identify symptoms of depression that do not overlap with common comorbid cognitive deficits or adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs. This preliminary instrument and several reliable and valid instruments for diagnosis of depression on the basis of criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV, depression symptom severity, health status, and toxic effects of medication were applied to 205 adult outpatients with epilepsy. We used discriminant function analysis to identify the most efficient set of items for classification of major depression, which we termed the neurological disorders depression inventory for epilepsy (NDDI-E). Baseline data for 229 demographically similar patients enrolled in two other clinical studies were used for verification of the original observations.FINDINGS: The discriminant function model for the NDDI-E included six items. Internal consistency reliability of the NDDI-E was 0.85 and test-retest reliability was 0.78. An NDDI-E score of more than 15 had a specificity of 90%, sensitivity of 81%, and positive predictive value of 0.62 for a diagnosis of major depression. Logistic regression showed that the model of association of major depression and the NDDI-E was not affected by adverse effects of antiepileptic medication, whereas models for depression and generic screening instruments were. The severity of depression symptoms and toxic effects of drugs independently correlated with subjective health status, explaining 72% of variance. Results from a separate verification sample also showed optimum sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power at a cut score of more than 15.INTERPRETATION: Major depression in people with epilepsy can be identified by a brief set of symptoms that can be differentiated from common adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs. The NDDI-E could enable rapid detection and improve management of depression in epilepsy in accordance with internationally recognised guidelines.",

Molecular mechanisms of axonal degeneration - a major pathological substrate for disability in MS - have been identified, pointing to the possibility of neuroprotection. Although previous studies were mainly carried out in laboratory models, recent analyses of human MS tissue have identified molecular targets that are related to mitochondrial function and specific isoforms of ion channels as contributors to axonal degeneration in MS. Taken together, the observations in model systems and in human tissue converge on the identification of a group of molecules that are related to ion fluxes and energetics as significant actors in the axonal-injury cascade, and suggest a set of molecular targets that might be useful in the development of new therapies.",

Visit characteristics and cholinesterase inhibitor prescriptions associated with dementia/AD status were evaluated.MAIN FINDINGS: A total of 25,561 visit records were identified. Of the total visits, only 0.6% had dementia/AD records. Most of the dementia/AD visits were made by women (60.6%) and white patients (93.5%). Of the dementia/AD visits, about half (46.5%) were prescribed with one or more cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil was the most prevalent agent (68.0%) followed by rivastigmine (26.0%). Logistic regression analyses indicated that the physician's specialty was a strong predictor for cholinesterase inhibitor prescription; psychiatrists [odds ratio (OR)=5.5; p<0.01] and neurologists (OR=2.6; p<0.03) were more likely to prescribe cholinesterase inhibitor than other physicians. Other characteristics including race did not show significant association.CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that physicians who specialized in psychiatry and neurology predominantly provided ambulatory care services for dementia patients. More efforts should be given to detect and to treat dementia patients with cognitive-enhancing agents after the formal diagnosis in the ambulatory care setting.",

Both patients had a chronic problem with drooling. One patient has gone from wearing a bib or bandanna, which was constantly wet from drooling to being essentially dry. After starting modafinil, both patients stopped drooling. The parents initially observed decreased drooling at home. Clinic appointment examinations and evaluations at physical therapy confirmed these observations. Better coordination and speech have been noted in each patient. Modafinil improves drooling in at least some patients with spastic cerebral palsy. The decreased drooling is due to improvements noted in swallowing.",

We report a family case associating congenital Thomsen's myotonia, strabismus, and ocular myopathy. We successively studied seven isolated patients presenting a myotonic disease and two controls and recorded the ocular saccades of these patients (amplitude, velocity) as a comparison for our family case.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four women from the same family presented Thomsen myotonia associated with strabismus. In addition to the clinical manifestations, the electro-oculographic analysis showed saccade alterations. The saccades of the seven other isolated patients, recruited in a neurology department, were evaluated by electro-oculographic recordings according to four different paradigms.RESULTS: The patients within our family case all presented esotropia, with or without a vertical oculomotor disorder. Clinical examination reported alterations in ocular motility--impairment and slowness of ocular movements--suggesting a myopathic disorder. The electro-oculographic recordings reported a slowing of saccades with increasing duration. For the isolated cases, the slowing of saccades observed was only reported for the patients with myotonic dystrophy (Steinert disease); nevertheless, we failed to show any myotonic phenomena.DISCUSSION: No cases associating Thomsen myotonia, strabismus, and electro-oculographic disorders have been reported in the literature to date. The electro-oculographic slowing of saccades is not rare in myotonic dystrophy (Steinert disease), but in Thomsen myotonia this has never been reported.CONCLUSION: This is the first report concerning Thomsen myotonia associated with strabismus and alterations of saccades. The mechanism of this disorder has yet to be discovered, as for Steinert disease.",

The Prospective Study Group (PSG) included those seen between February 2001 and March 2003.RESULTS: During the combined study periods of 10 years and 7 months, 117 children (61 males and 56 females, aged one month-12 years) were evaluated; the majority (89%) of these were Saudis. The calculated annual hospital frequency rate of stroke was 27.1/100,000 of the pediatric (1 month-12 years) population. The mean age at onset of the initial stroke in the 104 Saudi children was 27.1 months (SD = 39.3 months) and median was 6 months. Ischemic strokes accounted for the majority of cases (76%). Large-vessel infarcts (LVI, 51.9%) were more common than small-vessel lacunar lesions (SVLL, 19.2%). Five patients (4.8%) had combined LVI and SVLL. Intracranial hemorrhage was less common (18.2%), whereas sinovenous thrombosis was diagnosed in 6 (5.8%) patients. A major risk factor was identified in 94 of 104 (89.4%) Saudi children. Significantly more hematologic disorders and coagulopathies were identified in the PSG compared to the RSG (p=0.001), reflecting a better yield following introduction of more comprehensive hematologic and coagulation laboratory tests during the prospective study period. Hematologic disorders were the most common risk factor (46.2%), presumed perinatal ischemic cerebral injury was a risk factor in 23 children (22.1%) and infectious and inflammatory disorders of the circulatory system in 18 (17.3%). Congenital and genetic cerebrovascular anomalies were the underlying cause in 7 patients (6.7%) and cardiac diseases in 6 (5.8%). Six patients (5.8%) had moyamoya syndrome, which was associated with another disease in all of them. Inherited metabolic disorders (3.8%) included 3 children with Leigh syndrome and a 29-month-old girl with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Systemic vascular disease was a risk factor in 3 children (2.9%) including 2 who had hypernatremic dehydration; and post-traumatic arterial dissection was causative in 3 cases (2.9%). Several patients had multiple risk factors, whereas no risk factor could be identified in 11 (10.6%).CONCLUSION: Due to the high prevalence and importance of multiple risk factors, a comprehensive investigation, including hematologic, neuroimaging and metabolic studies should be considered in every child with stroke.",

Neuroimaging for suspected cases of stroke consisted of cranial CT, MRI, or both.RESULTS: During the study period, 23 (22%) of 104 children (aged one month to 12 years) were diagnosed to have had perinatal stroke. The male:female ratio was 1.6:1. Ten (67%) of the 15 children who had unilateral ischemic involvement had their lesion in the left hemisphere. The presentation of the ischemic result was within 24-72 hours of life in 13 (57%) patients, and in 6 children (26%), motor impairment was recognized at or after the age of 4 months. Nine children (39%) had seizures at presentation. Pregnancy, labour, and delivery risk factors were ascertained in 18 (78%) cases. The most common of these included emergency cesarean section in 5 cases, and instrumental delivery in another 5. Screening for prothrombotic risk factors detected abnormalities in 6 (26%) patients on at least one test carried out between 2 months and 9 years of age. Four children (17%) had low protein C, which was associated with low protein S and raised anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) in one patient, and low antithrombin III in another. Low protein S was detected in a 42-month-old boy. The abnormality in the sixth child was confined to raised ACA.CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the non-specific features by which stroke presents during the neonatal period. The data are in keeping with the potential role for inherited and acquired thrombophilia as being the underlying cause. However, the high prevalence of additional acquired antenatal and perinatal risk factors support a multifactorial disorder.",

This research lead to the \"loss of complexity hypothesis\" where decreased variability is associated with loss of healthy flexibility rendering the system more rigid and unable to adapt to stresses. ApEn as a measure of variability and complexity, correlates well with pathology while, in some cases, it is predictive of subsequent clinical changes. The study of human gait could benefit from the application of ApEn since it is also a rhythmical oscillation. Our aim was to assess the variability of the ACL deficient knee, since ACL rupture is a common musculoskeletal injury and is accompanied by altered gait patterns and future pathology in the joint. We hypothesized that the ACL deficient knee will exhibit more regular and less variable walking patterns than the contralateral intact knee.METHODS: Ten subjects with unilateral deficiency walked on a treadmill at their self-selected speed, 20% faster, and 20% slower, while kinematics were collected (50 Hz) from 80 consecutive strides for each condition. The ApEn of the resulted knee joint flexion-extension time series was calculated.RESULTS: Significantly smaller ApEn values were found in the ACL deficient knee when compared with the contralateral intact (F = 5.57, p = 0.022), for all speeds. ApEn values significantly increased (F = 5.79, p = 0.005) with increases in walking speed.CONCLUSIONS: The altered properties of the ACL deficient knee, which exhibits more regular and less variable patterns than the contralateral intact knee, may decrease the adaptability of the system rendering it less able to adjust to perturbations. This could explain the increased future pathology found in the deficient knee. ApEn can be an important tool in assessing pathology and therapeutic interventions in orthopaedics.",

After defining study variables, patient charts were abstracted for clinical and demographic data. Statistical analyses used log-rank tests and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients discontinued AEDs at a median time of 5.6 years from the first seizure (range, 1.2-19.6 years). Median time since AED withdrawal was 2.3 years (range, 0.4-15.1 years). Seizures recurred in 17 (27%) patients within a median time of 0.8 years (range, 0.06-7.7 years). Median seizure-free period before AED withdrawal was 1.3 years (range, 0.1-11 years). More than one tumor resection and whole-brain radiation treatment (WBRT) were associated with seizure recurrence, whereas posterior fossa tumor location was correlated with reduced seizure recurrence risk. At seizure recurrence, control was easily reestablished in 10 patients with AED reinstitution and after dose adjustment in five; two patients with poor drug compliance continue to have seizures. In 48 patients who had an EEG before AED withdrawal, spikes or slow waves did not correlate with seizure recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: AED withdrawal can be successfully achieved in majority of carefully selected patients. WBRT and multiple tumor resections seem to be associated with an increased hazard for seizure recurrence.",

In dermatology, they provide therapeutic benefit in Kawasaki disease and certain cases of dermatomyositis. While most adverse effects following IVIG treatment are not severe, occasionally more severe adverse effects occur, including anaphylactic reactions and acute, usually transient, renal failure.OBSERVATIONS: We report 4 cases of a characteristic severe extensive eczematous reaction that occurred approximately 10 days after IVIG infusion for polyradiculoneuritis. In all cases, onset was characterized by dyshidrotic lesions on the palms, rapidly followed by pruriginous maculopapular lesions involving the whole body. All patients were treated with topical and/or systemic steroids, and complete resolution of skin lesions was observed within 1 month. To date, 33 cases of cutaneous rash following IVIG infusion have been reported in the literature, mostly in neurology journals, and the features are identical to those reported herein.CONCLUSIONS: Severe eczematous skin reaction with a characteristic initial localization to the palms and/or soles that then extends to the rest of the body is a rare but characteristic adverse effect of high-dose IVIG therapy. Although the precise mechanism of this cutaneous eruption remains to be elucidated, its occurrence within days of IVIG infusion, its characteristic distribution at onset, and its clinical course should be recognized by dermatologists.",

      "abstractText": "To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units. Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N=44] and SARS ICU [N=26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N=15] and CCU [N=17]). Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support. Results showed that depression (38.5% vs. 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs. 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses. No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively) (p<0.05). For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p<0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred. The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit. Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings. Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress. In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.",

P. Franck (1745-1823) and the \"phrenology\" by F. J. Gall (1745-1823). Under the influence of the great pathologist C. Rokitansky (1804-1878), the tripode of the Vienna neurology - L. T?rck (1810-1868), as initiator, Th. v. Meynert (1833-1892) the activator, and H. Obersteiner (1847-1922) as the founder of the Vienna Neurological Institute, presented basic contributions to the morphology and pathology of the nervous system. At the end of the 19(th) and in the early 20(th) century, they were followed by important publications by S. Fred (aphasia), C. Redlich (tabes dorsalis), F. Str?ussler (CNS syphilis), A. Spitzer (fiber anatomy of the brain), P. Schilder (diffuse sclerosis), R. Barany (Nobel price for physiology and medicine 1914), J. Wagner v. Jauregg (Nobel price for medicine, 1927), O. Loewi (Nobel Price for Physiology and Medicine together with Sir H. Dale, 1936), A. Sch?ller (histiocytosis X), C. v. Economo (encephalitis lethargica and cytoarchitectonics of the human cerebral cortex), E. Pollak (Wilson disease), E. Gamper (mesencephalic subject), J. Gerstmann (Gerstmann-Str?ussler-Scheinker syndrome and Gerstmann parietal syndrome), H. Hoff with L. Sch?nbauer (brain tumors and surgery), and others. Major research institutions were the departments of psychiatry I and II at the University of Vienna School of Medicine (foundation 1870), unification 1911, separation into departments of neurology, psychiatry and neuropsychiatry of children and adolescents in 1971), the Obersteiner Institute in Vienna (foundation 1882, separation 1993), the university departments at Graz and Innsbruck, both founded in 1891, and other laboratories, where renouned clinicans and neuroscientists, like O. Marburg, H. Hoff, O. P?tzl, O. Kauders, F. Seitelberger, H. Tschabitscher, K. Weingarten, H. Reisner,W. Birkmayer, H. Petsche, F. Gerstenbrand, H. Bernheimer, H. W. Heiss, H. Lassmann, W. Poewe, L. Deecke, and many of their associates produced important contributions to wide areas of modern neurosciences. Important for the future are the foundation of the Institute of Brain Research at Vienna Medical University and of the Austrian Society of Neurology which will give further impact for the future progress of neuroscience research in Austria and its integration into the international science community.",

Six subspeciality areas accounted for the vast majority of the chronic conditions seen: neurology (30%), cardiology (18%), pulmonology (18%), nephro-urology (16%), haemato-oncology (9%) and endocrinology (4%). Admission rate to the hospital was significantly higher for chronically ill patients (38% vs 23%). Among chief complaints, fever, respiratory distress, headache and seizures were overrepresented in chronically ill children. The chief complaint was related to the child's chronic condition in 51% of the visits. In both chronically and non-chronically ill patients, the majority of final diagnoses were related to infection (57% and 65%, respectively). Among diagnoses, bacterial infections, seizures, vasovagal syncopes and asthma were overrepresented in chronically ill children.CONCLUSION: From the analysis of our data, we conclude that children with chronic conditions account for a tenth of all visits to a paediatric emergency department. The paediatric emergency physicians provide an important service to both the children with chronic conditions and the subspecialists who care for them.",

We determined whether particular dopamine and opioid receptor polymorphisms were associated with risk of earlier onset of dyskinesia side effects during levodopa therapy. Smoking status was also examined. The 92 subjects were recruited from the movement disorders clinic of a neurology practice associated with a medical school. All were adult-onset PD patients who had been taking levodopa at least 5 years and/or had developed levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Carrying the G-allele of the A118G single nucleotide coding region polymorphism of the mu opioid receptor, as well as a history of never smoking, were independently associated with increased risk of earlier onset of dyskinesia (P=0.05 and 0.02, respectively). One genotype of the D2 dopamine receptor intronic dinucleotide repeat polymorphism (14 repeats/15 repeats, with frequency of 6%) was also associated with earlier dyskinesia (P=0.003). History of smoking has previously been associated with reduced risk of developing PD. Our results suggest that smoking history may also influence the response to levodopa, with contribution comparable to those of individual genes including the mu opioid receptor and D2 dopamine receptor.",

We reviewed patients treated during 10 years period (from 1992 to 2002). Analysed group consisted of 14 patients. Reasons for hospitalisation were swallowing problems in 6 patients, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in 3 patients, stroke in 2 patients, bolus choking in 2 patients, and speech disturbance in 1 patient. Working diagnosis for most of our patients was neurological disease, yet only later D-IMD diagnosis was established excluding primary neurological disease, or as associated disease to basic neurological disorder. Nine patients have diagnosed as Parkinson syndrome, 3 patients as NMS, and 4 as orolingual dyskinesia, either autonomously, or in combination with Parkinson syndrome. D-IMD was most frequently caused by neuroleptics. Thus the small number of patients hospitalised regarding this syndrome on Department of Neurology.",

In this way we were able to draw conclusions about neurological improvement or deterioration in response to conservative or operative treatment.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with diving injuries of the cervical spine who were admitted to our institute over a 34-year period from 1970 until 2004.RESULTS: The typical patient profile was of a young, healthy, athletic male who suffered an injury to the cervical spine after diving into shallow water. The number of cases corresponds to 2.6% of all admitted cervical spine injuries. All injures occurred between May and September. The most commonly fractured vertebrae were C5 and C6. Four patients were treated operatively and 16 conservatively. The indications for surgical treatment were posttraumatic instability and persistent neurological deficit. The mean follow-up of the patients was 17 years. Five patients died within the first month of their hospitalization and 1 patient died 1 year after his injury. Of the 14 patients who were available for follow-up 5 years past injury time, 6 improved neurologically and 8 remained unchanged in relation to their neurology upon admission. Of the 11 patients who were available for follow-up 10 years past injury time, 9 remained neurologically unchanged, 1 deteriorated, and 1 improved in relation to their neurology in the 5-year follow-up.CONCLUSION: Diving injuries of the cervical spine demonstrate high mortality and morbidity rates. Recovery depends on the severity of the initial neurological damage. Conservative treatment is justified in specific patients and can lead to improvement of the initial neurological deficit.",

All patients were submitted to conventional brain MRI including axial T1-, T2-weighted and Fluid attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) sequences. MRIs were evaluated blindly to clinical features to determine extension of the infarct to presumed topographies of the ventral trigeminothalamic (VTT), lateral spinothalamic, spinal trigeminal tracts and spinal trigeminal nucleus.RESULTS: Sensory symptoms or signs were ipsilateral to the bulbar infarct in 3 patients, contralateral in 4 and bilateral in 1. In all of our cases with exclusive contralateral facial sensory symptoms, infarcts had medial extensions that included the VTT topography. In cases with exclusive ipsilateral facial sensory abnormalities, infarcts affected lateral and posterior bulbar portions, with slight or no medial extension. The only patient who presented bilateral facial symptoms had an infarct that covered both medial and lateral, in addition to the posterior region of the medulla.CONCLUSION: Our results show a correlation between medial extension of LMIs and presence of contralateral facial sensory symptoms.",

Patients were followed monthly for 12 months. At each visit, data on functional autonomy measured by the Barthel index and the treatments received were collected.RESULTS: One hundred and seventy patients aged 25 to 90 years (mean 61+/-13 years) were evaluated. The sex ratio was 0.68. A total of 64.7% of strokes involved ischemic cerebral vascular accidents and 35.3% hemorrhagic vascular accidents. Right hemiplegia was present in 55.9%, left hemiplegia in 42.9% and bilateral paresis in 1.2% of patients. A total of 28.8% of patients died between d0 and d30, 50.6% within one year. At entry, the Barthel score was greater than 60 in only 4.7% of patients. After one-year follow-up, 58.3% of the patients had a Barthel score greater than 60, 19.1% had a score between 20 and 40 and 22.6% a score between 40 and 60. Only 53.5% received rehabilitation care. The parameters significantly associated with a functional recovery were age less than 55 years (P<0.05), hemorrhagic vascular accident as opposed to ischemic vascular accident (P<0.05), and earlier rehabilitation care under qualified personnel (P<0.01).DISCUSSION: Our study shows an important rate of mortality during the first year following stroke and the rather young age of our population. The parameters associated with a better functional recovery are comparable to most of the data in the literature. The results of our study suggest that it is possible to improve functional prognosis after stroke by setting measures of prevention of the risk factors and rehabilitation in the early management of hemiplegia.",

Investigated disorders included excessive daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy, insomnia, sleep apnea, restlessness, and parasomnias. Unlike previous studies, subjects were compared with matched control patients by age and sex. Both headache and nonheadache groups completed a 111-item questionnaire detailing sleep symptoms and behaviors. It was found that children with headaches have a significantly higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy, and insomnia than children without headaches (P < 0.005), which is consistent with prior literature. A similar result was obtained in examining only migraines. However, we did not find a significantly higher prevalence of symptoms of sleep apnea, restlessness, and parasomnias, which contradicts previous literature. Also, the effect of medications taken by headache patients as a confounding factor was insignificant. Overall, pediatricians may find it beneficial to ask about daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy, and insomnia when treating a headache patient.",

Epilepsy syndromes, as defined by the ILAE, group patients according to various, poorly defined parameters. The resulting syndromes have frequently no biological significance, with overlap among different syndromes and syndromes changing with age. Additionally, only a minority of patients can be classified syndromatically, and the axes of this classification system convey redundant information. We propose a five-dimensional, patient-oriented approach to classifying epilepsies. This approach shifts from the syndrome-oriented approach to a standard, neurological, methodological, patient-oriented approach, using independent criteria in each of the five dimensions. Similar to general neurology, the first step in each patient-physician encounter in epileptology is to take a history of the presenting symptoms and generate a hypothesis regarding the localization and etiology of the symptom within the nervous system. Therefore, the main dimensions of this classification consist of: 1) localization of the epileptogenic zone, 2) seizure semiology classified according to the semiological seizure classification, 3) etiology, 4) seizure frequency, and 5) related medical conditions. These dimensions characterize all of the information necessary for patient management, are independent parameters, and include more pertinent information with regards to patient management than the ILAE axes. All patients can be classified according to this five-dimensional system even at the initial patient encounter when no detailed test results are available. Information from clinical tests, such as MRI and EEG, are translated into the best possible working hypothesis at the time of classification, allowing for increasing precision of the classification as additional information becomes available. This patient-oriented classification envisions an epileptic seizure as an independent symptom of a central nervous system dysfunction due to different causes, with various cortical localizations, occurring at various frequencies, and in conjunction with other diseases and clinical symptoms.",

The main reasons were for diagnosis of unexplained fever (42.3%) and for antibiotic modification according to culture results (18%). Diagnoses made by the ID consultant were pneumonia (16.7%), urinary tract infections (9.3%), bone and joint prosthesis infections (9.1%) and in 15.7% of the investigated patients, no infectious focus was determined. It was recognized that the use of antibiotics had already been initiated in the great majority of patients (67.1%) before the consultation request. While the current therapy was changed in 57.4% of these patients, antibiotics were not necessary for 9.8%.CONCLUSIONS: Since the most common diagnoses were respiratory and urinary tract or bone and joint prosthesis infections, the ID specialists should have detailed knowledge of these problems. Usage of antibiotics without ID consultation was prevalent, therefore a continuous educational program is a necessity for healthcare workers in the hospital.",

Where possible, quality of care was judged on measurable outcomes in relation to published statements of likely optimal care. Comparisons were made over time within the St John's region, and separately for hospitals in the rest of the province.RESULTS: There was improvement in the use of thrombolytics and secondary measures post-myocardial infarction in both regions. Mortality and appropriateness of initial antibiotic choice for community-acquired pneumonia remained stable in both regions, with an improvement in admission appropriateness based on the severity in St John's. Aspects of stroke management (referral and time to see allied health professionals, imaging and discharge home) improved in both regions, while mortality remained stable. There was improvement in fistula rate, quality of dialysis and anaemia management in haemodialysis patients, and improvement in the peritoneal dialysis patient peritonitis rate. Readmission rate for schizophrenia remained unchanged. Stable mortality rates were observed for frequently performed surgical procedures. The post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) morbid event rate improved, although access to CABG was not optimal.CONCLUSIONS: Aggregation of acute care hospitals was feasible without attendant deterioration in patient care, and in some areas care improved.

The albumin gene was the internal genomic control and MT2 cells were used as positive control. The results are reported as copies/10,000 PBMC, and the detection limit was 10 copies. A total of 89 subjects (44 HAM/TSP and 45 healthy HTLV-I-infected carriers) followed up at the Institute of Infectious Diseases \"Emilio Ribas\" and in the Neurology Division of Hospital of Cl?nicas were studied. The asymptomatic HTLV-I-infected carriers had a median number of 271 copies (ranging from 5 to 4756 copies), whereas the HAM/TSP cases presented a median of 679 copies (5-5360 copies) in 10,000 PBMC. Thus, HAM/TSP patients presented a significantly higher HTLV-I proviral DNA load than healthy HTLV-I carriers (P = 0.005, one-way Mann-Whitney test). As observed in other persistent infections, proviral DNA load quantification may be an important tool for monotoring HTLV-I-infected subjects. However, long-term follow-up is necessary to validate this assay in the clinical setting.",

All patients included into the study had a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis according to the McDonald criteria. Mean age of the studied patients was 36 years, mean disease duration--8 years. Patients were investigated with the use of Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Gough and Heilbrunn Adjective Check List (ACL)--a questionnaire designed for the study.RESULTS: . Using the T-Student test, we compared results from MS patients in the period of relapse and in remission. Our results revealed statistically significant differences in the level of anxiety in State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and in Free Child (FC) scale of Adjective Check List (ACL).CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that patients in relapse have a higher level of anxiety, more negative attitude towards themselves, lack of self-confidence and they isolate more from the society as compared to multiple sclerosis patients in remission.",

We evaluated the immediate and sustained effects of Qigong on motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD, using an add-on design. Fifty-six patients with different levels of disease severity (mean age/standard deviation [SD], 63.8/7.5 years; disease duration 5.8/4.2 years; 43 men [76%]) were recruited from the outpatient movement disorder clinic of the Department of Neurology, University of Bonn. We compared the progression of motor symptoms assessed by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III) in the Qigong treatment group (n = 32) and a control group receiving no additional intervention (n = 24). Qigong exercises were applied as 90-minute weekly group instructions for 2 months, followed by a 2 months pause and a second 2-month treatment period. Assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. More patients improved in the Qigong group than in the control group at 3 and 6 months (P = 0.0080 at 3 months and P = 0.0503 at 6 months; Fisher's exact test). At 12 months, there was a sustained difference between groups only when changes in UPDRS-III were related to baseline. Depression scores decreased in both groups, whereas the incidence of several nonmotor symptoms decreased in the treatment group only.",

We surveyed neurosurgeons to evaluate practice patterns with regard to using AEDs in neurosurgical patients with brain tumors.METHODS: The survey consisted of 18 questions. Two group email blasts containing an internet link to the survey were sent to members of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons with email addresses. Uni- and multi-variate analysis of the responses was performed using t-test, Fisher's exact test, or chi-squared test, where appropriate.RESULTS: The response rate was 15.5% (386/2491). The majority of respondents (270/386; 70.0%) had more than 5 years of experience in neurosurgery. Most respondents described their practices as general (224/379; 59.1%); about one-third were members of the Joint Section on Tumors (136/381; 35.7%). More than 70% of respondents reported routine use of AED prophylaxis for patients with intra-axial gliomas or brain metastases. AED prophylaxis was also routinely used for extra-axial benign tumors or stereotactic biopsies by 53.8% and 21.4%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the number of years in practice of ABNS certified neurosurgeons was the strongest predictor for the use of AED prophylaxis.CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of AED prophylaxis in patients with brain tumors undergoing neurosurgical procedures remains the prevailing practice pattern among members of the AANS. Additional larger prospective studies with appropriate patient stratification culminating in development of neurosurgical guidelines on AED prophylaxis in brain tumor patients is warranted.",

We devised a new coma score, the FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score. It consists of four components (eye, motor, brainstem, and respiration), and each component has a maximal score of 4. We prospectively studied the FOUR score in 120 intensive care unit patients and compared it with the GCS score using neuroscience nurses, neurology residents, and neurointensivists. We found that the interrater reliability was excellent with the FOUR score (kappa(w) = 0.82) and good to excellent for physician rater pairs. The agreement among raters was similar with the GCS (kappa(w) = 0.82). Patients with the lowest GCS score could be further distinguished using the FOUR score. We conclude that the agreement among raters was good to excellent. The FOUR score provides greater neurological detail than the GCS, recognizes a locked-in syndrome, and is superior to the GCS due to the availability of brainstem reflexes, breathing patterns, and the ability to recognize different stages of herniation. The probability of in-hospital mortality was higher for the lowest total FOUR score when compared with the lowest total GCS score.",

Vasodilatation as a response to local heating is a biphasic mechanism: the first phase (neurogenic) is mediated by the axon-reflex and is modulated by activity of sympathetic nerves. Our objective was to determine whether the response to heat provocation in trunk dermatomes may provide a measure of vasomotor sympathetic function in SCI.SETTING: National Spinal Injuries Centre, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire, UK; Autonomic Unit, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK; Neurovascular Medicine Unit, Imperial College London at St Mary's Hospital, UK.SUBJECTS: A total of 30 subjects were studied; 18 had chronic complete SCI (level C6-T11) and 12 were healthy controls.METHODS: Recordings of skin blood flow (SkBF) were obtained with thermostatic laser Doppler probes placed in the upper trunk (at C4) and lower trunk (T10 or T12) dermatomes.RESULTS: SkBF at baseline (SkBF(bas)) and SkBF at the first peak of vasodilatation (SkBF(max)) showed no significant differences between SCI and controls either in upper or lower trunk dermatomes. However, the ratio of SkBF(max)/SkBF(bas) was significantly different in lower trunk dermatomes in SCI at C6-T5 level (7.5+/-3.5 PU) compared to SCI at T6-T11 level (3.5+/-1.5 PU) (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Measurement of SkBF in response to local heating may provide a safe, noninvasive method to assess integrity of sympathetic spinal pathways to the local vasculature. This may aid the classification of the SCI lesions, as the autonomic component currently is not included in the accepted American Spinal Injury Association scoring.",

For all 27 children seen with a definite diagnosis of AES between 1972 and 2002, a review of clinical histories, videotapes, and EEG/ECG studies was undertaken. Main outcome measures were: age of onset, frequency and type of syncopes; age of onset and frequency of AES; type and duration of induced epileptic seizures; effect of treatment of syncopal and epileptic components.RESULTS: Median age of onset of syncopes was 8 months (range 0.2-120), frequency 2 in total to 40/day, median total approximately 200. Syncopes were predominantly reflex asystolic (RAS), prolonged expiratory apnoea (cyanotic breath-holding spells), or of mixed or uncertain origin; there was one each of ear piercing and hair grooming vasovagal syncope and one of compulsive Valsalva. Median age of onset of AES was 17 months (range 7-120), frequency from total 1 to 3/day, median total 3. The epileptic component was almost always bilateral clonic; three had additional epilepsy, one each with complex partial seizures, myoclonic absences, and febrile seizures plus. Median duration of epileptic component was 5 minutes (range 0.5-40, mean 11). Cardiac pacing prevented RAS in two patients: most other anti-syncope therapies were ineffective. Diazepam terminated the epileptic component in 6/8. Valproate or carbamazepine abolished AES in 5/7 without influencing syncope frequency.CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon compared with simple syncopes, syncope triggered epileptic seizures (AES) are an important treatable basis of status epilepticus.",

Therefore, epidemiological data on pyridoxine dependency are scarce.AIMS: To study the epidemiology of pyridoxine dependent epilepsy in the Netherlands, and to determine whether the diagnosis is based on the appropriate criteria.METHODS: Nationwide all departments of paediatrics (n = 113) and of paediatric or neonatal neurology (n = 17) were asked to report cases of pyridoxine dependent seizures. Birth incidences were calculated using national data on live births from 1991 to 2003.RESULTS: Response was received from 67% of paediatric departments, including all university hospitals and 94% of child neurology departments. Thirteen patients were reported. Four definite (31%), three probable (23%), and four possible cases (31%) were identified. Two cases (15%) did not meet criteria for either of these groups. The birth incidence was 1:396,000 for definite and probable cases and 1:252,000 when possible cases are included.CONCLUSIONS: Thus far, epidemiological data on pyridoxine dependent seizures were only available from the UK and Ireland. A higher incidence was found in the Netherlands, in accordance with earlier suggestions of a regional difference. The study shows that the diagnosis is often made without performance of a formal trial of withdrawal. The importance of confirming the diagnosis, concerning the consequences as for individual prognosis, the potential side effects of prolonged pyridoxine substitution, and the possibility of treating the mother in case of future pregnancies are emphasised.",

Of the 15 scale items, two (facial palsy and limb ataxia) had low inter-rater values (k values below 0.39). Kappa (kappa) values were substantial (over 0.60) for all other items. The C-NIHSS has a significantly negative correlation with both Glasgow Coma Scale (r = -0.824, p < 0.01), and Barthel index (r = -0.683, p < 0.01) scores.CONCLUSIONS: The C-NIHSS is a reliable and valid scale for the clinical assessment of neurological deficit in acute stroke patients.",

The morbidity and mortality of neurologic complaints such as headache and stroke can be extensive. Thus, emergency medicine residency programs should ensure adequate training in such neurologic emergencies. The authors sought to determine what methods are being used to educate residents on neurologic emergencies.METHODS: A two-page survey was mailed to directors of all 126 accredited emergency medicine residency programs in the United States. The number and types of lectures to residents, required rotations, and electives offered were assessed. Means, standard deviations (SDs), and proportions are used to describe the data. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals of proportions (95% CIs) were calculated.RESULTS: The response rate was 78% (98 of 126). Programs had a mean (+/- SD) of 5.4 (+/- 1.0) hours of didactic lectures per week, with a mean of 12.0 (+/- 5.9) lecture hours devoted to neurologic emergencies annually. A neurology rotation was required for 16 of the 92 programs providing these data (17.4%; 95% CI = 10.6% to 27.0%), and a neurosurgery rotation was required for 14 of these 92 programs (15.2%; 95% CI = 8.9% to 24.6%). One program (1.1%; 95% CI = 0.1% to 6.8%) required both a neurology and a neurosurgery rotation, and one program (1.1%; 95% CI = 0.1% to 6.8%) required either a neurology or a neurosurgery rotation. On 15 of the 32 required neurologic rotations (46.9%; 95% CI = 29.5% to 65.0%), time was spent only in the intensive care unit. The remaining 17 rotations used outpatient clinic and general floor neurology settings. Electives in neurology, neurosurgery, or neuroradiology were available for 32 programs (32.7%; 95% CI = 24.2% to 42.4%) but were seldom used.CONCLUSIONS: Currently, the primary method of educating residents to treat neurologic emergencies is through didactic lectures, as opposed to clinical rotations in neurology or neurosurgery. Improving resident education in neurologic emergencies within the current educational format must focus on improving didactic lectures in neurologic topics. Expanding clinical rotations or electives to enhance education in neurologic emergencies also warrants future attention.",

In the present study we have investigated the occurrence of central pain (CP) in MS and defined its characteristics. Questionnaires were sent to all 429 patients with definite MS in the patient register at our neurology department. All admitting to pain were interviewed and offered an extended interview and examination. Three hundred and sixty four patients responded (86%), of whom 57.5% reported pain during the course of their disease (21% nociceptive, 2% peripheral neuropathic and 1% related to spasticity). One hundred patients (27.5%) had CP, including 18 patients (4.9%) with trigeminal neuralgia. The non-trigeminal CP was, in 87%, located in the lower and in 31% in the upper extremities. It was mostly bilateral (76%) and constant, with 88% experiencing daily pain. Only 2% had paroxysmal attacks. Aching, burning, pricking were the commonest qualities. The pain was intense with small to moderate spontaneous variation. In 5.5% of all patients (20% of the patients with CP), pain was a presenting symptom, alone or in combination with other symptoms. The most common neurological symptoms/signs besides CP were sensory abnormalities (98%, dominated by abnormal sensibility to painful stimulus and temperature). Trigeminal neuralgia in MS started later in life and after longer disease duration than non-trigeminal pain. Both types of CP existed either chronically or as a feature of relapse. Central pain is thus an important symptom in MS (around 30%) and causes much suffering.",

Gait analysis is established as a useful diagnostic tool in patients with gait problems, as it is not possible to obtain an adequate and detailed understanding of such a complex mechanism as gait in a conventional clinical examination. The method has provided a better understanding of both normal gait and abnormal gait patterns; it is a suitable instrument for evaluation of treatment results as well as for scientific work. The first gait laboratory for clinical use in Norway was established in 2002 in the Section for child neurology at Rikshospitalet University Hospital in Oslo, Norway. In this article the procedure for gait analysis is described and the clinical value is indicated by a case record of a child with cerebral palsy. Gait analysis has entailed a change of policy with regard to surgical treatment in this patient group. Previously, operative intervention at a single level was usual, whereas current practice involves simultaneous interventions at several levels of both lower extremities. After three years' experience we recommend gait analysis in routine diagnostics, particularly as a preoperative evaluation, in all children with gait problems and in the follow up after surgery or other treatment.",

We illustrate such a case and review the existing literature regarding this severe complication.SETTING: Obstetric unit at an academic medical center.PATIENT: A 34-year-old primigravida experienced a pontine hemorrhage and subsequent respiratory arrest 22 hours after a normal delivery. This hemorrhage occurred 7 hours after the sudden onset of hypertension, severe headache, and intermittent abdominal pain.RESULTS: Laboratory and postmortem evidence suggested HELLP syndrome with disseminated intravascular coagulation as the cause of her intracerebral hemorrhage.CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests the importance of the neurology consultant's familiarity with HELLP syndrome and the need for thorough laboratory testing and close monitoring in the puerperal patient with headache and hypertension.",

To develop this practice parameter, the authors reviewed available evidence regarding initiation of pharmacologic and surgical therapies, duration of their effect, their relative benefits and risks, and the strength of evidence supporting their use.METHODS: A literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and CINAHL was performed to identify clinical trials in patients with ET published between 1966 and August 2004. Articles were classified according to a four-tiered level of evidence scheme and recommendations were based on the level of evidence.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol and primidone reduce limb tremor (Level A). Alprazolam, atenolol, gabapentin (monotherapy), sotalol, and topiramate are probably effective in reducing limb tremor (Level B). Limited studies suggest that propranolol reduces head tremor (Level B). Clonazepam, clozapine, nadolol, and nimodipine possibly reduce limb tremor (Level C). Botulinum toxin A may reduce hand tremor but is associated with dose-dependent hand weakness (Level C). Botulinum toxin A may reduce head tremor (Level C) and voice tremor (Level C), but breathiness, hoarseness, and swallowing difficulties may occur in the treatment of voice tremor. Chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) (Level C) and thalamotomy (Level C) are highly efficacious in reducing tremor. Each procedure carries a small risk of major complications. Some adverse events from DBS may resolve with time or with adjustment of stimulator settings. There is insufficient evidence regarding the surgical treatment of head and voice tremor and the use of gamma knife thalamotomy (Level U). Additional prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to better determine the efficacy and side effects of pharmacologic and surgical treatments of ET.",

Patients commencing adjunctive therapy with one of five AEDs (topiramate, lamotrigine, gabapentin, clobazam, vigabatrin) were eligible for inclusion. The study took place at the outpatient clinics of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London. Patients completed the EQ-5D, a generic health status measure, at baseline and again after 3 and 6 months. Information was also collected on medications and seizure frequency.RESULTS: In total, 125 patients entered the study and were followed up for 6 months. Patients treated with topiramate had a significant increase (p < 0.05) in EQ-5D score from baseline, indicating an improvement in their health status whereas scores for lamotrigine, clobazam and gabapentin all showed a non-significant decline. When the data were analysed according to seizure frequency, only patients who became seizure-free on adjunctive treatment had a significant increase in their health status. The group who had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency did not have increased health status.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, adjunctive treatment with topiramate significantly increased health status as measured by the EQ-5D. These data also suggest that achievement of seizure-freedom is the key to improving health status in this patient group.",

Recommendations were developed by members of the Brain Attack Coalition (BAC), which is a multidisciplinary group of members from major professional organizations involved with the care of patients with stroke and cerebrovascular disease.SUMMARY OF REVIEW: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from 1966 through December 2004 using Medline and Pub Med. Articles with information about clinical trials, meta-analyses, care guidelines, scientific guidelines, and other relevant clinical and research reports were examined and graded using established evidence-based medicine approaches for therapeutic and diagnostic modalities. Evidence was also obtained from a questionnaire survey sent to leaders in cerebrovascular disease. Members of BAC reviewed literature related to their field and graded the scientific evidence on the various diagnostic and treatment modalities for stroke. Input was obtained from the organizations represented by BAC. BAC met on several occasions to review each specific recommendation and reach a consensus about its importance in light of other medical, logistical, and financial factors.CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of key areas supported by evidence-based medicine that are important for a comprehensive stroke center and its ability to deliver the wide variety of specialized care needed by patients with serious cerebrovascular disease. These areas include: (1) health care personnel with specific expertise in a number of disciplines, including neurosurgery and vascular neurology; (2) advanced neuroimaging capabilities such as MRI and various types of cerebral angiography; (3) surgical and endovascular techniques, including clipping and coiling of intracranial aneurysms, carotid endarterectomy, and intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy; and (4) other specific infrastructure and programmatic elements such as an intensive care unit and a stroke registry. Integration of these elements into a coordinated hospital-based program or system is likely to improve outcomes of patients with strokes and complex cerebrovascular disease who require the services of a comprehensive stroke center.",

However, the underlying cerebral abnormalities in idiopathic PKC have not been elucidated. To localise cerebral perfusion abnormalities in PKC, we performed interictal brain perfusion 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer (ECD) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in PKC patients and in normal controls.METHODS: Sixteen patients with idiopathic PKC and 18 age- and sex-matched normal controls were included. The patients were de novo diagnosed as having PKC, or had not taken medication for at least 3 months; none of them had structural abnormalities on MRI. Patients had a history of PKC attacks of a duration not exceeding 5 min and starting either on one side or on both sides of the body. These attacks were always induced by a sudden initiation of voluntary movement. PKC attacks were recorded in a hospital after being induced by neurology staff in 13 of the 16 patients. Interictal brain perfusion 99mTc-ECD SPECT was performed in all 16 patients and 18 normal controls. Differences between the cerebral perfusion in the PKC group and the normal control group were tested by statistical parametric mapping. Student's t test was used for inter-group comparisons.RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, patients with idiopathic PKC showed interictal hypoperfusion in the posterior regions of the bilateral caudate nuclei (false discovery rate-corrected P<0.001 with a small volume correction).CONCLUSION: This study showed that cerebral perfusion abnormality of bilateral caudate nuclei is present in idiopathic PKC.",

However, in the EpiBase population, localization-related symptomatic epilepsies were more frequent in men (n=939; w=426 (45%), m=513 (55%); p=0.005); and cryptogenic localization-related epilepsies were more frequent in women (n=572; w=324 (57%), m=248 (43%); p=0.002). In generalized epilepsy, more women than men were diagnosed in both populations [EpiBase: n=480, w=280 (58%), m=200 (42%); p<0.001; twin population: n=105, w=63 (60%), m=42 (40%); p=0.05]. The difference was confined to idiopathic generalized epilepsy [EpiBase: n=437, w=259 (59%), m=178 (41%); p<0.001; twin population: n=94, w=60 (64%), m=34 (36%); p=0.01].CONCLUSIONS: More women than men were diagnosed with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in two epilepsy populations. Overall, no gender difference was found in localization-related epilepsy, but localization-related symptomatic epilepsies were more frequent in men, and cryptogenic localization-related epilepsies were more frequent in women The results suggest a gender susceptibility to the development of specific epilepsy subtypes.",

Children were identified from hospital database and neurology clinic records. Seizure status was characterized for the 6 months prior to most recent follow-up.RESULTS: Median follow-up after first seizure of the 157 analyzed children was 3.3 years. Tumor location was supratentorial in 81% and posterior fossa in 19%. Initial anti-epileptic drugs were phenytoin (n=52), carbamazepine (n=38), phenobarbital (n=14), gabapentin (n=31), or others (n=22). Seizures were controlled in 65% of the children and uncontrolled in 35% (17% intractable). Gabapentin showed a trend toward better seizure control (p=0.06). Neurologic deficit, T2 peri-cavity hyperintensity, and EEG slow waves were independently predictive of uncontrolled seizures by multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: T2 peri-cavity hyperintensity, focal neurologic deficits, and EEG slow waves predict poor seizure control in children with brain tumors. Seizures can be controlled in most patients with brain tumors. Gabapentin use as first anti-epileptic drug needs to be studied prospectively.",

SPECT scans were assessed by five raters (two neurologists and three nuclear medicine specialists) on two occasions 6 months apart, first without any clinical data and second with brief pertinent clinical information. SPECT diagnoses were compared with criterion diagnoses subsequently established by the two neurologists with access to all clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data. Despite reasonable intra- and interrater reliability, diagnostic accuracy ranged from 32 to 58%. SPECT scan normality or abnormality in blind and informed viewings gave respective sensitivities of 77 and 71%, specificities of 44 and 38%, positive predictive values of 88 and 87% and negative predictive values of 27 and 18%. Calculating pairwise disease group comparisons, likelihood ratios suggested some diagnostic gain in differentiating AD from 'not AD' and from FTD/focal syndromes. SPECT scanning was of little help in establishing diagnoses in this cohort of patients, a finding which supports the conclusion of the American Academy of Neurology evidence-based review that SPECT imaging cannot be recommended for either the initial or the differential diagnosis of suspected dementia because it has not demonstrated superiority to clinical criteria.",

Patients with epilepsy have traditionally been discriminated by both the general population and physicians. A physician's lack of knowledge about epilepsy could be the cause of an incorrect clinical control (CC).AIMS: The purpose of this study is to examine the origins of the knowledge, the CC and the attitudes of physicians in Tenerife with respect to the treatment of patients with epilepsy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In January 2003, all Primary Care physicians in Tenerife were given a questionnaire that asked them about their knowledge, CC and attitudes when dealing with cases of epilepsy. Of the 260 surveys initially sent out, 182 were returned.RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 70% of doctors, of which 34 were paediatricians and 148 were general practitioners, with no differences between sexes. Most physicians acquire their knowledge, observe and treat their first seizure in the Faculty and during their period of hospital residency. 44% of them are barely or not at all satisfied with their knowledge on the subject. The most highly valued therapists are neurologists and neuropaediatricians. The goal that is sought is to eliminate the impact of the disease on the patient's quality of life. They rarely establish or modify antiepileptic treatment and state that they have doubts about neuropsychological disorders and integrating patients with epilepsy in the workplace.CONCLUSIONS: The physicians in Tenerife define themselves as professionals with scant knowledge about epilepsy and feel they are poorly qualified to treat patients with the disease, who are usually referred to specialists in Neurology.",

The descriptions were compared with other cases that have been published in the medical literature of the last 150 years. Cerebral imagery shows a lesion that is most often localized on the internal capsule. After comparison with experimental models in cats, it is proposed that the section of the cortico-neocerebellum tract of the extra-pyramidal system disinhibits the spino-archeocerebellum tract, enabling a motor stimulation of the arm by the lateral reticular nucleus, which harmonises central respiratory and locomotor rhythms.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Some subcortical structures, that are phylogenetically more ancient, thus disinhibit regained autonomy in the homeostasis process associating the massive inspiration of yawning--a form of reflex behavior that stimulates vigilance--with a motor control that is active during locomotion. For this phenomenon we coined the term \"parakinesia brachialis oscitans\".",

Eligible patients had solid tumors for which treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel was appropriate. The primary end point was a standardized composite peripheral nerve electrophysiology (CPNE) score, based on nerve velocities and amplitudes, measured at baseline and after four cycles of chemotherapy. Secondary efficacy end points included CPNE score at last cycle and at exit evaluation, vibration perception threshold, H-reflex latency, symptom scores, and quantitative assessment of neurologic signs. Study drug was given s.c. daily for 7 days starting the day before chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive low-dose rhuLIF (2 microg/kg), high-dose rhuLIF (4 microg/kg), or placebo.RESULTS: Patients (n = 117) were randomized across seven neurology test centers. Thirty-six patients received low dose rhuLIF (2 microg/kg), 39 received high dose rhuLIF (4 microg/kg) and 42 received placebo. rhuLIF was well tolerated with 95% compliance and no adverse effects on quality of life. No differences between groups in CPNE or any of the individual neurologic testing variables were observed between baseline and cycle 4 or by the secondary efficacy variables.CONCLUSIONS: rhuLIF is not effective in preventing CIPN caused by carboplatin and paclitaxel. CPNE is a reliable and valid tool that was sensitive to the onset and progression of CIPN.",

The children were followed up for a mean duration of 17 months. We analyzed the clinical findings and the relationships between neurologic sequelae, recurrence, age of onset, presumptive causes, types of seizure, seizure duration and the presence of fever. Mean age at SE onset was 37 months. Incidences by seizure type classification were generalized convulsive SE in 73.5%, and non-convulsive SE in 26.5%. The incidences of presumptive causes of SE were idiopathic 40.7%, epilepsy 29.1%, remote 16.4% and acute symptomatic in 13.3%. Among all the patients, febrile episodes occurred in 35.4%, especially in patients under 3 year old, and 38.4% of these were associated with febrile illness regardless of presumptive cause. Neurologic sequelae occurred in 33% and the mortality rate was 3%. Neurologic sequelae were lower in patients that presented with an idiopathic etiology and higher in generalized convulsive SE patients. The recurrence of SE was higher in patients with a remote symptomatic epileptic etiology, and generalized convulsive SE showed higher rates of recurrence. Based on this retrospective study, the neurologic outcomes and recurrence of SE were found to be strongly associated with etiology and seizure type. Age, seizure duration and the presence of febrile illness were found to have no effect on outcome.",

We report a 19-yr-old female, working as a high-altitude chamber instructor, who presented with severe frontal headaches which persisted for a month following routine high altitude chamber training. The patient was in generally good health and was using oral contraceptives for 3 yr prior to the event. Due to the unremitting nature of the symptoms, the patient was admitted to a neurology department, and computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. Sagittal and transverse sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed and anticoagulant therapy was initiated (low molecular weight heparin followed by warfarin). Following treatment, a slow symptomatic improvement was observed, and the patient was discharged. On discharge, it was recommended she continue oral anticoagulant therapy (warfarin). A complete coagulation screening panel was performed, which was negative. Although the relation between high altitude exposure and a hypercoagulable state is well known, this is the first time a case of sinus vein thrombosis has been reported after high altitude chamber training. Careful history and closely monitored medical follow-up should be performed on all designated staff exposed to simulated altitude. Even though there is no conclusive evidence regarding it, we suggest, as a matter of caution, that women using oral contraceptives should consider their risks before deciding to undertake exposure to simulated altitude in chambers.

Exclusion criteria were cardiovascular disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, bundle branch block and use of medication affecting QT interval duration.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IMT of common (CCA) and internal carotid arteries (ICA) was measured by B-mode ultrasound. QT interval duration was determined in the resting 12-lead electrocardiogram by an automatic analysis program. The QT intervals were corrected for heart rate with five standard equations (QTc-Bazett, -Fridericia, -Framingham, -Hodges and -Rautaharju) and tested for their relationship with carotid IMT after adjustment for clinical and metabolic variables. Results. Females had higher heart rates than males (64 +/- 10 b min(-1) vs. 60 +/- 9 b min(-1), P <0.0005), with longer mean QT (410 +/- 28 ms vs. 404 +/- 28 ms, P=0.003) and QTc intervals in all correction formulae (P <0.0005). Significant correlations between QT/QTc and ICA IMT (r=0.14-0.16) were found in males. In the general linear model the association between QTc (except for Bazett) and ICA IMT remained significant after adjusting for age, BMI and further cardiovascular risk factors. In females the crude correlations between QT/QTc and ICA IMT were lower than those with CCA IMT. Only the correlation between uncorrected QT and CCA IMT (r=0.15, P=0.006) remained significant after adjustment for covariates.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that QT and QTc prolongation are in part associated with IMT of carotid arteries, which is an established risk marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. In men the data support the hypothesis of an association between QTc and ICA IMT. In women a statistically significant relationship was found between the uncorrected QT interval and CCA IMT. These findings suggest that differences in carotid IMT and ventricular repolarization between genders might be related to hormonal and nonhormonal effects.",

Our aim was to analyse the findings from electrooculography studies in subjects with FA attended in our Service over a 30-year period.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between the years 1970 and 1999, 51 patients with FA diagnosed in the Neurology Service of our hospital were examined. All of them were submitted to an electronystagmography study and an examination of the oculomotor system using electrooculography (EOG). In the EOG study, saccades, (square-wave) saccadic intrusions, spontaneous, triggered, positional and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), visual suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and following were all evaluated.RESULTS: The disorders that were found most often were ataxic following (72.5%), abnormalities in rotational testing (56.8%) and dysmetria in the saccades (52.9%). The presence of square waves was observed in just over half the traces (52.9%).CONCLUSIONS: In FA the predominant EOG findings are those suggesting a cerebellar disease.",

Patients with valproic acid-responsive vs valproic acid-refractory epilepsy formed distinct subclusters. Tourette syndrome was characterized by several gene expression clusters. In 1 cluster, 6 genes-all associated with immune cell function-were overexpressed.CONCLUSION: Blood gene expression profiling can provide surrogate markers for neurologic diseases without obvious blood phenotypes.",

In the second part of the study, we started cisapride with the children with documented gastroesophageal reflux and evaluated the efficacy of cisapride with the second 24-hour pH monitoring. This study was performed before discontinuation of cisapride with US Food and Drug Administration reports in Turkish markets. Twenty-eight children who had been followed up in the Department of Pediatric Neurology between 1999 and 2000 were enrolled in the study. Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring was performed on all patients. Two parameters were evaluated as pathologic: a reflux index (percentage of time the pH value was <4) over 4.5% and reflux longer than 15 minutes even when the reflux index was below 4.5%. Cisapride treatment was assigned to the patients with pathologic monitoring results at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day for 3 months. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were analyzed before and after cisapride treatment. Symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal dysfunction were dysphagia in 18 cases (64.3%), constipation in 8 cases (28.6%), vomiting in 6 (14.2%) cases, and recurrent pneumonia in 2 cases (8.5%). The reflux index was > or =4.5% in 13 (46.4%) of the 28 cases. Reflux was longer than 15 minutes in 2 (7.1%) cases. Cisapride was started in 15 cases with pathologic monitoring results. Appetite improved in 6 cases and dysphagia disappeared in 8 cases after cisapride therapy (P < .05). pH monitoring was repeated in 12 cases after 3 months and was normal in 8 of them. Improvement in the reflux index and total reflux episodes was statistically significant after therapy (P = .008). No adverse effects occurred. Even though the drug is no longer marketed, we concluded that it improved the symptoms and quality of life in spastic children with gastroesophageal reflux.",

      "abstractText": "Neuroimaging and management advances require review of indications for excluding cerebral venous sinus (sinovenous) thrombosis (CSVT) in children. Our goals were to examine (i) clinical presentations of CSVT, (ii) prothrombotic risk factors and other predisposing events, (iii) clinical and radiological features of brain lesions in CSVT compared with arterial stroke, and (iv) predictors of outcome. We studied 42 children with CSVT from five European paediatric neurology stroke registries. Patients aged from 3 weeks to 13 (median 5.75) years (27 boys; 64%) presented with lethargy, anorexia, headache, vomiting, seizures, focal signs or coma and with CSVT on neuroimaging. Seventeen had prior chronic conditions; of the 25 previously well patients, 23 had recent infections, eight became dehydrated and six had both. Two children had a history compatible with prior CSVT. Anaemia and/or microcytosis (21 probable iron deficiency, five haemolytic, including two with sickle cell disease and one with beta-thalassaemia) was as common (62%) as prothrombotic disorder (13/21 screened). High factor VIII and homozygosity for the thermolabile methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism were the commonest prothrombotic disorders. The superficial venous system was involved in 32 patients, the deep in six, and both in four. Data on the 13 children with bland infarction and the 12 with haemorrhage in the context of CSVT were compared with those from 88 children with ischaemic (AIS) and 24 with haemorrhagic (AHS) arterial stroke. In multiple logistic regression, iron deficiency, parietal infarction and lack of caudate involvement independently predicted CSVT rather than arterial disease. Five patients died, three acutely, one after recurrence and one after 6 months being quadriparetic and blind. Follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 10 (median 1) years. Twenty-six patients (62%) had sequelae: pseudotumour cerebri in 12 and cognitive and/or behavioural disabilities in 14, associated with epilepsy in three, hemiparesis in two and visual problems in two. Eighteen patients, including six with haemorrhage, were anticoagulated. Older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% confidence limits (CI) 1.12, 2.13, P = 0.008], lack of parenchymal abnormality (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02, 1.56, P = 0.1), anticoagulation (OR 24.2, 95% CI 1.96, 299) and lateral and/or sigmoid sinus involvement (OR 16.2, 95% CI 1.62, 161, P = 0.02) were independent predictors of good cognitive outcome, although the last predicted pseudotumour cerebri. Death was associated with coma at presentation. Of 19 patients with follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) venography, three had persistent occlusion, associated with anaemia and longer prodrome. A low threshold for CT or MR venography in children with acute neurological symptoms is essential. Nutritional deficiencies may be modifiable risk factors. A paediatric anticoagulation trial may be required, after the natural history has been further established from registries of cases with and without treatment.",

The aim was to document and analyze cases of aneurysm or AVM with brain infarction. Survey on 4804 stroke patients treated at the Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland between 1978 and 2000 using the Lausanne Stroke Registry. Twenty patients presented with cerebral aneurysm and 21 with cerebral AVM. Hemorrhage was present in 100% of the AVM and in 75% of the aneurysm patients; in one (5%) of the remaining aneurysm patients, aneurysm and infarction were located in different territories. Infarction associated with Sylvian artery aneurysm was found in three (15%), vertebrobasilar ischemia because of fusiform left vertebral artery aneurysm in one (5%), and dural fistula draining to the distal transversal and left sigmoid sinus associated with a stroke in the territory of the left anterior inferior cerebellar artery in one patient. Ischemic stroke is infrequent, but important, complication in unruptured intracranial aneurysms and AVMs. The early recognition and therapy of these vascular malformations in selected patients can avoid a major neurological deficit or death caused by their rupture.",

The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the use of the diet worldwide.METHODS: With the use of the Internet, e-mail requests for information about international ketogenic diet centers (outside the United States) were made over a 9-month period. Assistance also was obtained from the Child Neurology Society and International League Against Epilepsy. Questions included patient enrollment (total and annually), year the diet was first offered, unique cultural and religious issues in the country, community opinion, and research interests.RESULTS: Successful communication was made with 73 academic centers in 41 countries outside the United States. Sixteen (39%) countries provided information from multiple centers. The median duration offering the diet was 8 years (range, 1-45 years). The average number of patients enrolled to date was 71.6 per country, with 5.4 new patients annually. Common difficulties included avoiding rice intake, tolerating higher fat-to-protein and carbohydrate ratios (e.g., 4:1), finding specific nutritional labels on foods, and handling the growing interest from large populations with limited resources. Nevertheless, cultural and religious issues were generally not limiting; physician and patient acceptance of the diet as an option is high; and most meals were similar among countries. Centers often had great pride in their programs, and international collaborative groups are forming rapidly. A website is now available with updated center information at http://www.neuro.jhmi.edu/Epilepsy/Peds/ketoworldwide.htmCONCLUSIONS: Despite occasional difficulties, the ketogenic diet is being used worldwide.",

It is important to investigate the associations between specific chromosome abnormalities and features of epilepsy to identify genes involved in epilepsy and treat them more effectively. We investigated the correlation between specific chromosome aberrations and epilepsy by sending questionnaires to the members of Kyoto Multi-institutional Study Group of Pediatric Neurology. Seventy-six patients were collected from 10 institutions. Chromosome abnormalities included: Down syndrome (n = 19); Angelman syndrome (n = 8); Prader-Willi syndrome (n = 4); 4p- syndrome (n = 3); 1q- syndrome (n = 2); 5p- syndrome (n = 2); Miller-Dieker syndrome (n = 2); 18q- syndrome; (n = 2); Klinefelter syndrome; (n = 2); and 32 other individual chromosomal aberrations. Overall, the severity of mental retardation correlated with the severity of epilepsy. We could abstract characteristic features of epilepsy in some syndromes. In Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes, febrile seizures occurred frequently, the onset of epilepsy was in early childhood and seizure phenotype was multiple. Paroxysmal discharge of the occipital region and diffuse high voltage slow wave on electroencephalography were characteristic in Angelman syndrome. In Down syndrome, West syndrome and focal epilepsy were common and the prognosis of epilepsy in West syndrome with Down syndrome was good. In 4p- syndrome, febrile seizures were often seen, and unilateral or generalized clonic or tonic-clonic status epilepticus were characteristic. For the other chromosomal aberrations investigated here, the patient numbers were too small to abstract common features of epilepsy.",

Human response to botulinum toxin injection: type B compared with type A. Neurology 49, 189-194]. Botulinum toxins block motor nerves as well as autonomic fibres [Rand, M.J., Whaler, B.C., 1965. Impairment of sympathetic transmission by botulinum toxin. Nature 206, 588-591].OBJECTIVE: Purpose of this study was to analyse the dose dependent reduction of sweating using the BoNT/A preparation Botox and to compare the results with our earlier results analysing Dysport [Braune, C., Erbguth, F., Birklein, F., 2001. Dose thresholds and duration of the local anhidrotic effect of botulinum toxin injections: measured by sudometry. Br. J. Dermatol. 144, 111-117] and Neurobloc (BoNT/B) [Birklein, F., Eisenbarth, G., Erbguth, F., Winterholler, M., 2003. Botulinum toxin type B blocks sudomotor function effectively: a 6 month follow up. J. Invest. Dermatol. 121, 1312-1316].METHODS: Different doses of Botox were injected subcutaneously (n=27 healthy subjects). Planimetrical analyses of the area of anhidrosis and quantitative sudomotor-axon-reflex testing (QSART) were done after 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months.RESULTS: A threshold dose of 1.25 MU Botox led to anhidrotic skin spots after 3 weeks. The duration of anhidrosis was prolonged for 3 months when 17.5 MU and for 6 months when 50 MU were injected. Anhidrotic area size decreased with time (p=0.001), indicating partial recovery at the edges. After 3 weeks, QSART had significantly decreased to 29% of baseline. With doses of 70 MU or more it decreased to zero. After 3 months, QSART had returned to 68% of baseline and after 6 months to 87%.CONCLUSIONS: Botox dose-dependently suppressed sweating. Comparison to Dysport and Neurobloc revealed a strikingly similar efficacy after 3 weeks and 3 months for all preparations. BoNT/A in general induced a more sustained anhidrosis than BoNT/B.",

Interviews were undertaken with 18 participants (5 men and 13 women) who attended a neurology outpatients department in the UK. Three features of the patients' narratives identified are: the 'chaotic' structure of their illness narratives; concern that symptoms may be 'all in the mind'; and their status as 'medical orphans'. All the patients acknowledge that diagnosis is difficult and accept that a medical explanation will invariably be possible. However, they are more concerned to secure some form of ongoing medical and social support. An understanding of both the structure as well as the content of patients' narratives of undiagnosed illness may contribute to the development of more effective and sensitive patient centred care.",

However, little is known about their quantity in S2 sleep of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).SETTING: Sleep laboratory, Department of Neurology, University of Vienna, Austria.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Whole-night polysomnography (PSG) was performed in twelve treated PD patients and ten healthy controls without history of sleep complaints. The quantity of spontaneous K-complexes, K-alpha-complexes, and sleep spindles in one hour S2 sleep, distributed in four epochs of 15 minutes all through the night, were visually selected and analysed. The quantity and the temporal course of these phasic events were compared with the quantity in age-matched healthy controls. Nine of the twelve PD patients underwent [123I]beta-CIT SPECT for calculating dopamine transporter binding in the striatum and serotonin transporter density in the thalamus-hypothalamus region.RESULTS: There was no difference between the quantity of K-complexes, K-alpha-complexes, and sleep spindles in PD patients and in the healthy control group. K-complexes but not sleep spindles decreased over the night in both groups. The number of sleep spindles did not correlate with the dopamine transporter binding in the striatum or the serotonin binding in the thalamic/hypothalamic region.CONCLUSION: K-complexes and sleep spindles are not reduced and do not seem to be related to the degree of dopaminergic degeneration in treated PD patients.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the long-term clinical outcome in a large series of young adults with ischemic stroke admitted to a tertiary medical center over the last 27 years, and to identify possible predictors for mortality, stroke recurrence and poor functional recovery.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 272 young adults (15-45 years) with a first-ever ischemic stroke admitted to the Neurology Department of University Hospital \"12 de Octubre\" between 1974 and 2001. Follow-up assessments were performed by review of medical records and telephone interviews.RESULTS: Nine patients (3%) died as the result of their initial stroke and follow-up information about the status of 23 (8%) patients was not available. The remaining 240 patients (89%) were followed. Two hundred and ten of them (88%) were alive with a mean follow-up of 12.3 years and 30 (12%) died during follow-up. The average annual mortality rate was 1.4%, being notably higher during the first (4.9%) than in the subsequent years (0.9%) after the initial stroke. Ninety per cent of the followed patients were independent and 53% returned to work, although adjustments were necessary for 23% of them. The annual stroke recurrence rate during the first year was 3.6% dropping to 1.7% in subsequent years. Age over 35 years, male gender, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and large-artery atherosclerosis in the carotid territory were predictors of negative long-term outcome after the initial stroke.CONCLUSIONS: The long-term prognosis for the ischemic stroke in the young is better than in the elderly, but the risk of mortality in young adults with ischemic stroke is much higher than in the general population of the same age. A bad prognosis is associated with an atherosclerotic risk profile, with a higher mortality and recurrent stroke rates and poorer functional recovery. The main functional limitation in the young survivors of their initial ischemic stroke occurs in work activity, since most patients are independent but almost half of them do not return to work.",

Recommendations were based on a four-tiered scheme of evidence classification, and areas for future research are defined.RESULTS: Seven class I studies and numerous less rigorous trials all demonstrated that corticosteroid treatment for 6 months with prednisone (0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg/day) increased muscle strength, performance, and pulmonary function and significantly slowed the progression of weakness. Two class I trials examined the effect of lower dosage of prednisone (0.30 and 0.35 mg/kg/day), demonstrated lesser but similar benefits, and showed a lower frequency of side effects (e.g., weight gain). The only significant side effects in all class I trials were weight gain and development of a cushingoid facial appearance. One longer-term trial of daily prednisone (0.3 to 0.7 mg/kg/day), a class III study, showed prolongation of functional ability and slower progression of weakness in patients during 3 years of treatment. One class IV, open trial of alternate-day prednisone (2 mg/kg for 2 months, then two-thirds dose every other day) extended ambulation by approximately 2 years in treated compared with untreated patients. Deflazacort, a corticosteroid similar in structure to prednisone, produced similar improvement in muscle strength and function with a similar side effect profile.CONCLUSIONS: Prednisone has been demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on muscle strength and function in boys with Duchenne dystrophy and should be offered (at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day) as treatment. If side effects require a decrease in prednisone, tapering to dosages as low as 0.3 mg/kg/day gives less robust but significant improvement. Deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg/day) can also be used for the treatment of Duchenne dystrophy in countries in which it is available. Benefits and side effects of corticosteroid therapy need to be monitored. The offer of treatment with corticosteroids should include a balanced discussion of potential risks.",

N., Tew, K. D., and Tapiero, H. (1999) Biomed. Pharmacother. 53, 169-180). Protein kinase C (PKC) gamma is a unique isoform of PKC that is found in neuronal cells and eye tissues. This isoform is activated by ROS such as H2O2. Mutations (H101Y, G118D, S119P, and G128D) in the PKCgamma Cys-rich C1B domain caused a form of dominant non-episodic cerebellar ataxia in humans (Chen, D.-H., Brkanac, Z., Verlinde, C. L. M. J., Tan, X.-J., Bylenok, L., Nochli, D., Matsushita, M., Lipe, H., Wolff, J., Fernandez, M., Cimino, P. J., Bird, T. D., and Raskind, W. H. (2003) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 72, 839-849; van de Warrenburg, B. P. C., Verbeek, D. S., Piersma, S. J., Hennekam, F. A. M., Pearson, P. L., Knoers, N. V. A. M., Kremer, H. P. H., and Sinke, R. J. (2003) Neurology 61, 1760-1765). This could be due to a failure of the mutant PKCgamma proteins to be activated by ROS and to subsequently inhibit gap junctions. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the cellular mechanism of activation of PKCgamma by H2O2 and the resultant effects on gap junction activity. H2O2 stimulated PKCgamma enzyme activity independently of elevations in cellular diacylglycerol, the natural PKC activator. Okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, did not affect H2O2-stimulated PKCgamma activity, indicating that dephosphorylation was not involved. The reductant, dithiothreitol, abolished the effects of H2O2, suggesting a direct oxidation of PKCgamma at the Cys-rich C1 domain. H2O2 induced the C1 domain of PKCgamma to translocate to plasma membranes, whereas the C2 domain did not. Direct effects of H2O2 on PKCgamma were demonstrated using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Results demonstrated that PKCgamma formed disulfide bonds in response to H2O2. H2O2-activated PKCgamma was targeted into caveolin-1- and connexin 43-containing lipid rafts, and the PKCgamma phosphorylated the connexin 43 gap junction proteins on Ser-368. This resulted in disassembly of connexin 43 gap junction plaques and decreased gap junction activity. Results suggested that H2O2 caused oxidation of the C1 domain, activation of the PKCgamma, and inhibition of gap junctions. This inhibition of gap junctions could provide a protection to cells against oxidative stress.",

It is a pathology that is prevalent in tropical regions that are endemic for HTLV-I (southern Japan, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and some areas of Africa).CASE REPORT: The authors report the case of a 9-year-old child from Guinea who was admitted to the Paediatric Neurology Unit in the Hospital de Santa Maria with a two-year-old clinical history of spastic paraparesis. Computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not show any alterations to the spinal cord. Somatosensory evoked potentials revealed a lesion in the posterior dorsolumbar spinal cord. The exclusion of other (infectious, metabolic and demyelinating) pathologies and the confirmation of infection by HTLV-I (by means of PCR) led to a diagnosis of myelopathy associated to this virus. Therapy was established with interferon alfa, but no appreciable significant improvement was observed.DISCUSSION: This case stands out because of the uncommonness of this pathology at the paediatric age. We review the most relevant aspects of this disorder at the earliest ages, above all with regard to its epidemiology, transmission, clinical symptoms and complementary diagnostic examinations. Known therapeutic options (corticoids, interferon alfa, antiretroviral agents, among others) and prognosis are also discussed.",

      "abstractText": "Several in vivo and in vitro studies showed that mitoxantrone (MTX), a novel anthracendione antineoplastic agent, had an immunomodulatory effect that suppressed humoral immunity, reduced T-cell numbers, lessened helper activity, enhanced suppressor function and had some positive effect on acute and chronic experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in rats. Up to now, several trials of therapy with MTX have been performed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). MTX has been recently shown to reduce disease activity, as expressed by reducing relapse rate and decreasing new, active MRI lesions, in a selected group of patients with active relapsing-remitting (RR) MS. Furthermore, more recently, it has been demonstrated that MTX reduce neurological disability in secondary progressive MS. We designed the open-label clinical trial involving 35 MS patients with active disease in order to evaluate the long-term clinical effects of 6-months MTX treatment during a follow-up period of 20-46 months (mean, 30 months). The study comprised 35 patients, who met the Poser criteria for clinically definite MS. All patients were clinically treated at the Institute of Neurology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, Belgrade, during the period from March 1996 to August 2000. The neurological disability state was evaluated at the entry, every month until completion of the therapy and every six months until August 2000, by means of Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. All patients had active MS. The criteria for disease activity were: 1) at least 2 relapses within the previous 2 years, or 2) progression of at least 1.0 point on EDSS scale during the same period. The included patients did not receive immunosuppressive therapy six months prior to the entry. The patients were assigned to receive MTX 20 mg intravenously (iv) per month and methylprednisolone 1g iv per month, over six months. The clinical characteristics and demographic data of patients included in the study were shown in table 1. The parameters monitored during the trial were shown in table 2. Clinical assessment showed a significant improvement of the final mean EDSS score after 6 months of the therapy as compared to the value at entry in the total MS group (p=0.00001). Although EDSS value showed an increasing tendency during the follow-up period (20-46 months), the mean EDSS value was still significantly lower at the end of the follow-up comparing to the value at entry (p=0.013) (Figure 1). Overall, MTX was well tolerated and only minor side effects occurred. Cardiotoxicity was not registered. Our findings further support the notion that mitoxantrone reduces neurological disability in active relapsing and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients. However, follow-up suggests that this effect slowly subsides after discontinuation of therapy, implying the need for prolongation of such treatment (up to 120 mg/m2) for a period as long as possible.",

The study population comprised all patients treated in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, oncology, and neurology wards (105,533 treatment periods and 65,526 patients) between July 1, 1996, and June 30, 2002 (6 years).RESULTS: Every fifth patient receiving losartan, codeine, or tramadol was concomitantly taking another drug that has the potential to inhibit the activation of these drugs. During the 6-year time period, 1999 patients were exposed to a potential interaction. Interactions occurred more commonly in internal medicine wards (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-2.5) and in women (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-1.7).CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of drugs that potentially result in inhibition of prodrug activation present a common and unrecognized source of irrational prescribing.",

Activity limitations of 166 patients with different neurologic disorders (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury) were assessed with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) during their stay in a rehabilitation hospital. Data analysis was performed with the Rasch model, which allows testing the psychometric qualities of the FIM. Results indicate that the FIM has good psychometric qualities. However, results also show that the 18 FIM items define two statistically and clinically different indicators. Thirteen items define disability in motor functions. Five items define disability in cognitive functions. Separate analyses of the two scales help to improve the psychometric quality of the FIM.",

We prospectively surveyed 415 adults with headache, who had been using the same triptan for at least 3 months. Participants were asked about their headache and treatment history. Subjects then completed a standardized questionnaire, assessing adverse events in two different ways. First, subjects were asked if they had any adverse events when using the triptan. After returning the first part of the questionnaire, subjects received a second form, where 49 possible adverse events were listed. We contrasted and correlated both sets of answers.RESULTS: Most patients (U.S.=74.9%, Italy=65.5%) reported no side effects in the unprompted questionnaire. However, most of them (U.S.=62.9%, Italy=54.1%) reported at least one side effect in the prompted questionnaire. Most patients that reported side effects in the unprompted questionnaire said they had just one adverse event, while most reported two or more side effects in the prompted questionnaire. Both in the unprompted and in the prompted questionnaires, most side effects were rated as mild or moderate. Interestingly, 31 (7.5%) subjects (pooling data from both sites together) graded their adverse events as severe in the prompted questionnaire, but had not self-reported them.CONCLUSIONS: (1) When assessing adverse events, the method of data collection may dramatically influence the results. (2) From those subjects who did not self-report adverse events after using a triptan, most of them will report positively if presented with a list of side effects.",

The main outcome parameter (\"response\") was a >50% reduction in the mean frequency of migraine auras at 3 to 6 months of treatment.RESULTS: A total of 47 patients had been treated with lamotrigine due to severe migraine aura. Three could not complete the protocol as a result of developing skin rashes. Thirty (68%) patients responded. These were 21 females and 9 males whose ages ranged from 19 to 71 years. Eight suffered from migraine with \"prolonged\" aura, 8 typical aura with migraine headache (but had frequent episodes including speech symptoms), 6 basilar-type migraine, 6 typical aura without headache, and 2 hemiplegic migraine. Fifteen had been previously treated, without response, with other preventatives. The mean monthly frequency of migraine auras in these 30 patients changed from 4.2 (range: 1 to 15) to 0.7 (range: 0 to 6). Response was considered as excellent (>75% reduction) in 21 cases (70% of responders). Auras reappeared in 2 months in 9 out of 13 patients where lamotrigine was stopped, and ceased as soon as this drug was reintroduced.CONCLUSIONS: Lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice for the preventive treatment of selected patients with disturbing migraine auras. Lamotrigine seems worthy of a controlled trial as prophylaxis of migraine aura.",

The following routine complementary tests were performed: 1. Analyses, including blood count, biochemical study, vitamin B12 and folic levels, thyroid hormones, and syphilis serodiagnosis; 2. Neuroimaging study, consisting in computerised axial tomography or cranial magnetic resonance.RESULTS: A total of 269 consecutive patients diagnosed as suffering from dementia were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 74.5 years (49-94 years) and 61% were females. The most frequent cause of dementia was Alzheimer's disease (79.9%). In all, 31 patients presented potentially reversible conditions (11.5%), but if we exclude depression, the dementia was only reversible in one patient (0.4%).CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of patients with reversible causes of dementia in the field of extra-hospital neurology is low. The diagnostic study must be individualised according to the clinical suspicion.",

Angiographic recanalization was related to CI (P<.01), lower follow-up National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (P<.05), the absence of a dominant ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery (P<.01) on initial MR angiography, and the sparing of the internal capsule on both initial (P<.05) and follow-up (P<.01) MR imaging. Clinical improvement was associated with the absence of ICA (vs MCA) flow signals (P<.05), the sparing of the internal capsule (P<.01), and marginally, with the infarct volume change (P = .06).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with MCA or ICA occlusion, CI after thrombolysis is related to the AR and the sparing of the critical motor pathway. The presence of a dominant ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery may predict poor AR after thrombolysis.",

YOPD has earlier onset of motor complications than later onset Parkinson's disease. Motor complications and disease progression are responsible for devastating morbidity. Current medical and surgical treatments can dramatically ameliorate motor complications and help maintain function and employment. Patient education, support, and advocacy provided by nursing staff can influence the treatment options for these patients, having a significant effect on the future course of the disease. This case history documents the course of a YOPD patient with unusually severe motor complications. He is the only patient at Puget Sound Neurology ever to develop rhabdomyolysis due to dyskinesias. Following bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, his Parkinson's symptoms have improved dramatically, and his motor complications are significantly improved.",

The multidimensional nature of satisfaction and its relationships with emotional distress and illness perception were also assessed within the two groups.DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort study was carried out at a large inner city teaching hospital.PARTICIPANTS: New attenders at cardiology and neurology out-patient clinics participated in the study.MEASURES: The Satisfaction Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Health Anxiety Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) were used in the study.RESULTS: There were no overall significant differences in satisfaction between organic and MUS patients. Factor analysis yielded four factors: satisfaction with information, satisfaction with style of doctor-patient interaction, satisfaction with clinic environment, and satisfaction with patient's health. Levels of internal consistency were good, with Cronbach's alphas between .74 and .95 for the four subscales.CONCLUSION: When considering patients with MUS, these findings emphasize the need to examine healthcare satisfaction from a detailed and multidimensional perspective. Relationships between satisfaction dimensions, clinic specialties and measures of psychological well-being and of illness perception show interesting patterns. These findings raise both theoretical and service delivery questions concerning communication strategies.",

Two hundred and sixty four (264) consecutive clinic attendees with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy participated in the study. Perceived Stigma Scale (PSS); Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory (WPSI-Modified): Becks Depression Inventory (BDI) and Crown-Crisp Experiential Index (CCEI). Significant main effect for seizure control, stigma, emotional adjustment, vocational adjustment, interpersonal adjustment, adjustment to seizures but not for age at onset of epilepsy, financial adjustment and gender, were recorded on depression. Similarly significant main effect for seizure control, stigma, emotional adjustment, adjustment to seizures but not for age at onset of epilepsy, gender, vocational adjustment, financial adjustment and interpersonal adjustment were recorded for neurotic disorders. The study highlights some of the factors, which may contribute to the understanding of epilepsy-related psychopathologies and implication for psychotherapeutic intervention among individuals with epilepsy in Nigeria.",

The study emphasized modifiable risk factors frequencies for ischemic stroke in this population, considering gender and age of the patients. Results have evidenced that systemic arterial hypertension is a main risk factor significantly frequent in old people (87.8%), independently of gender and age. Smoking (46.9%) and alcohol consumption (35.1%) have revealed to be very frequent important modifiable risk factors especially among men. Lower frequencies have been presented for cardiac diseases (27.0%), Diabetes Mellitus (19.9%), and dyslipidemia (15.6%) as risk factors for ischemic stroke in old people of both genders and all ages after 60. There was relatively low frequency of hyperuricemia in this set of patients.",

Main outcome measures Isometric neck strength was measured by a special neck strength measurement system. Disability was measured by the Neck Disability Index, and pain and symptoms of cervical dystonia by a visual analog scale.RESULTS: Isometric neck strength in all directions measured was significantly lower (25%-44%) in the cervical dystonia patients than in the healthy controls. Neck pain levels reported during the strength tests (r range, -.36 to -.70) and neck pain experienced during the preceding week (r range, -.52 to -.63) were inversely associated with isometric strength results. The difference between sides in rotation strength was 35% in the patient group (P<.001), whereas no significant difference between sides was found in the healthy controls. Fifty-one percent of the patients reported moderate or severe disability. Pain, stiffness, and incorrect position of the head were the most prominent symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Cervical dystonia patients with botulinum toxin-treated neck muscles showed significantly lower maximal neck strength than healthy controls. The patients also had a statistically significant difference between sides in neck rotation strength. Thus, strength measures may be useful to detect disturbance in the function of the neck muscles.",

In the first period almost all deceased patient has been autopsied, but the ratio decreased on 68.9% between 1990-2002. The average age of autopsied patients (39.1 +/- 2.9 years) almost doubled after 40 years (69.5 +/- 2.0 years). In the first period (1938-1951) the infectious and tumorous cases were most frequent (33.6% and 31.2%), while in the second one, the cerebrovascular diseases dominated (84.5%). There was no significant difference between the treatment lengths of two periods (18.1 and 14.5 days, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: While the absolute number of autopsies raised after 40 years, the ratio decreased at our department (from 100% to 68.9%), similarly to the worldwide trends. The significantly higher age of autopsied patients and the different spectrum of clinical diagnosis reflects the decrease of infectious diseases and increase of stroke frequency and the ageing of the Hungarian population. Authors sustain with literary data that autopsy should not be ignored, and are convinced, together with professor Mohr, that \"autopsy is the ultimate audit of medicine, the yardstick of clinical care and research. To dispence with autopsy is an unfortunate trend that certainly endangers the value of clinical research.\"",

Our data included patient demographics, primary tumor, location of the metastatic tumor within the spine, indication for surgical or non-surgical treatment, type of surgical and non-surgical intervention, post-treatment outcome in terms of neurology, use of adjuvant radiation therapy or systemic therapy.RESULTS: The most frequent indication for surgical treatment was the combination of neurological deficit (ND), pathological vertebral fracture, and pain (50 %). Surgical intervention was performed by the posterior approach in 67 %, by the anterior approach in 13 %, and by an anterior/posterior approach in 10 %. The post-surgical outcome, depending on the type of surgical approach in terms of ND, was for the posterior approach 29 % improved, for the anterior approach 53 % improved, and for the anterior/posterior approach 15 % improved.DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that the indications for metastatic tumor surgery in the spine depend on the location of the metastatic tumor in the spine, clinical symptoms, and prognosis.",

The investigation involved 53 Italian neurology centers: of these, 50 treat acute patients and 3 provide rehabilitation care; 21 centres are in Northern Italy, 20 are in Central Italy, and 12 are in Southern Italy. The time schedule was articulated into three phases: registration of 6289 stroke patients; selection of 1817 cases and enrollment of 1074 patients; and follow-up for two years (1064 patients). Mood assessment was performed by evaluating depressive symptoms according to DSM IV and the Beck depression inventory (visual analog mood scale for aphasic patients). Depressed patients were also administered the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale. Scores were related to function (Barthel index, modified Rankin scale), cognition (MMSE), quality of life (SF-36), and clinical data. Data analysis will provide information on PSD prevalence, onset and evolution, correlation with ischemic clinical syndrome, impact on activities of daily living, cognitive level and quality of life. The few data available at the present time concern PSD prevalence in the first six months after stroke (33.6%). DESTRO is a longitudinal investigation of a large patient sample and is expected to provide insights into the relationship of PDS with the functional and clinical consequences of stroke.",

From the original sample of 113 patients, 46 participated in the study, 22 met exclusion criteria, and 43 were not available.INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In this study, 46 patients were included (27 men, 19 women; 68.4 +/- 9.9 years of age; symptomatic disease duration, 12.2 +/- 5.2 years; Hoehn and Yahr stage in \"on\" of 2.6 +/- 0.8). Out of the 46 patients, 13 had LL genotype, 22 LH, and 11 HH. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were 9.5 +/- 4.8 in LL, 8.5 +/- 4.7 in LH, and 6.8 +/- 3.1 in HH (mean +/- SD) (NS). LL and LH were grouped together. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 11 or more in 40% of the LL+LH group, compared to 9.1% of the HH group (P = .039). The levodopa or dopamine-agonist doses and types did not differ between the LL+LH group versus the HH group.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest an association of the Lallele and daytime sleepiness in patients with Parkinson disease.",

Diagnoses were stratified into three categories: no neurological diagnosis, neurological-headache, and neurological-nonheadache.RESULTS: Of 235 patients enrolled, 79 (34%) received no neurological diagnosis, 54 (23%) headache and 102 (43%) a neurological diagnosis. Overall, 39% had an underlying psychiatric disorder. Patients with psychiatric disorders were less likely to have a neurological diagnosis (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.90): 25% of patients with a neurological diagnosis had an underlying psychiatric disorder, compared to 43% among those with no diagnosis and 57% among those with headaches.CONCLUSION: Psychiatric disorders are common among neurology referrals, particularly those with headaches and are associated with a decreased likelihood of an underlying neurological process.",

The first clinical signs were seen between two days and three weeks after injury. The bacteriologic examination of serous fluid from the site of injury revealed an infection with Clostridium. EMG in one cat during anaesthesia showed motor united potentials (MUPs) on the spastic leg. All patients received antibiotics (Penicillin, respectively Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid and Metronidazol). Supportive aid were initially sedation, wound revision and in one cat nutrition through oesophageal sonde. In a second phase physiotherapy was performed. All three animals were significantly better after a couple of weeks, two cats were without symptoms after eight and five weeks respectively.",

They were surveyed through the outpatient clinic of the department of dermatology. Each patient filled out a total neuropathy score (TNS) questionnaire after their neurologic exam. A neurology specialist conducted the electrophysiological study. Our results were noteworthy because this complication was present without significant complaint. We hypothesized that the nerve dysfunction or peripheral neuropathy of BD is an axonal type of distal polyneuropathy and predominantly involves the lower extremities. We did not find a predominant motor or sensory nerve involvement. This complication is mentioned and reported rarely in BD.",

Reference lists of major guidelines were crosschecked. Control or nested case-control studies of children with head injury who had skull radiography, recording of common symptoms and signs, and head computed tomography (CT) were selected.OUTCOME VARIABLE: CT presence or absence of ICH.RESULTS: Sixteen papers were identified as satisfying criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, although not every paper contained data on every correlate. Available evidence gave pooled patient numbers from 1136 to 22 420. Skull fracture gave a relative risk ratio of 6.13 (95% CI 3.35 to 11.2), headache 1.02 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.69), vomiting 0.88 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.15), focal neurology 9.43 (2.89 to 30.8), seizures 2.82 (95% CI 0.89 to 9.00), LOC 2.23 (95% CI 1.20 to 4.16), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15 of 5.51 (95% CI 1.59 to 19.0).CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant correlation between intracranial haemorrhage and skull fracture, focal neurology, loss of consciousness, and GCS abnormality. Headache and vomiting were not found to be predictive and there was great variability in the predictive ability of seizures. More information is required about the current predictor variables so that more refined guidelines can be developed. Further research is currently underway by three large study groups.",

There were five women and one man with a mean age at presentation of 25.7 years (range, 25-32 yr). All were obese but had no other associated medical conditions or identifiable risk factors for IIH. In five patients, all or most cerebrospinal fluid cells were lymphocytes. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis persisted for several months in all patients. Patients underwent a thorough laboratory and neuroimaging evaluation that did not reveal a primary cause. Medical treatment directed solely at lowering intracranial pressure was effective in five patients; one patient required lumboperitoneal shunting. Ophthalmic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure stabilized or remitted after treatment was withdrawn with a mean follow-up period of 33 months (range, 14-55 mo). Some patients may present with idiopathic chronic meningitis and elevated intracranial pressure that responds to treatment used for IIH.",

All outpatient records between 1995 and 2001 were considered. We calculated trends and specific rates of morbidity per 100 discharged patients.RESULTS: The main causes of morbility were brain tumors, schizophrenic illness, neurocysticercosis, and stroke. We found a statistically significant declining time-trend of schizophrenic illness and in non-traumatic brain hemorrhage in males. In the case of females, we observed an increasing time-trend of benign meningeal tumors. The age groups more affected in both genders were those < 51 years of age.CONCLUSIONS: This study is not a population study, but it helps to increase knowledge of the main causes of hospitalization at one of the most important neurologic institutions in the world, which provides care for thinsured population throughout Mexico. These findings facilitate analysis and decision-making to undertake specifications to improve the quality of neurologic medical attention.",

Joseph F. F. Babinski worked in the shadow of his mentor, Jean M. Charcot, until 1893, but then developed independent studies to examine patients with both types of weakness.OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the role of Babinski in differentiating organic paralysis from hysterical paralysis and to describe his influence on 2 US neurologists, Charles Gilbert Chaddock and Charles Franklin Hoover.DESIGN: Primary and secondary sources were studied to outline the discoveries of Babinski and to determine his influence on US neurology.RESULTS: Babinski described toe extension in cases of organic paralysis and specifically stated that this sign did not occur in cases of hysterical paralysis. Chaddock and Hoover were influenced by the work of Babinski and disseminated his discoveries to US neurologists, each developing additional techniques to differentiate the 2 forms of paralysis. Each considered his technique superior to the Babinski toe sign.CONCLUSIONS: Although Babinski was only modestly appreciated by his contemporary peers of French neurology, his influence on US neurology was substantial. The Babinski, Chaddock, and Hoover signs that demonstrate whether structurally related upper motor neuron weakness exists continue to be useful maneuvers in separating these forms of paralysis from psychogenic weakness.",

It is generally divided into pre-graduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education, with the physician as the main target. It usually covers aetiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, outcome and long-term effects. Neurology is a large field in medical science, focusing on diseases of the brain, the spinal cord, the peripheral nerves and muscles. They tend to be chronic and, often progressive, leading to long-term disability and handicap for the individual, frequently associated with personal, social and emotional consequences. In the time span of a patient with a neurological disease, interaction with physicians is important and often vital, but interaction with other health groups and relatives or other caregivers is longer and more intensive. The knowledge and experience of the patient and caregiver is equally important, in that an informed patient or caregiver is more likely to participate actively and be of greater benefit in disease management. This paper promotes the concept that education in neurology should be integrated to include the physicians and other professionals as well as patients, caregivers and public. A broader awareness of neurological diseases will draw support and improve the approach of society to the provision of resources and management of these illnesses, as well as public attitude towards the symptoms and to those who live with them. Two bodies have collaborated in writing this article: the education committee of the EFNS and the EFNA.",

Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus was diagnosed if the patient had either a fasting glucose concentration of 126 mg/dl or greater, or a random glucose concentration of 200 mg/dl or greater. The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of whether SDM had developed (13 patients) or not (12 patients). Ages, body mass indexes, cumulative total doses and daily doses of prednisolone, duration of therapy, and serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were compared between the groups. Thirteen of the 25 patients were identified with SDM, and all of them had plasma glucose concentrations of 200 mg/dl or greater 2 hours after lunch. Mean age (59.1 +/- 10.2 yrs) and cholesterol concentration after prednisolone treatment (226.8 +/- 36.4 mg/dl) in the SDM group were significantly higher than those values in the non-SDM group (41.3 +/- 18.0 yrs and 188.1 +/- 27.2 mg/dl, respectively, p<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: A close relationship among postprandial hyperglycemia, advanced age, and hypercholesterolemia is a characteristic of SDM in patients with neurologic diseases. Therefore, monitoring the plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after lunch may be useful to detect SDM in these patients.",

The typical neurological picture (facial myopathy, myotonia, muscle atrophy) may be associated with cardial, endocrine and ocular symptoms.METHODS: The diagnosis is based on electromyography, muscle biopsy and genetical tests. Muscle histology is characterized by high frequency of central nuclei. Genetical tests detect CTG repeat expansion of the involved gene.AIMS: Authors summarize 9 cases found in the Neurology Clinic of Pecs University in the last three years.RESULTS: The prevalence is lower than expected, therefore some cases might be unrecognized. After recognizing the typical clinical picture, electrophysiological, muscle biopsy, brain MRI, psychologic and molecular genetic studies were performed. Six patients belonged to 3 families and 3 sporadic cases were found. In all except one patient mild neurocognitive deficit was detected. Three patients had cataract and cardiac involvement.CONCLUSIONS: The authors emphasize that in cases of cardial, endocrine and central nervous system involvement myotonic dystrophy must be considered and detailed examinations are necessary for early detection of the specific organ manifestations.",

We set out to study the impact of ischemic heart disease, minor stroke, hypertension and diabetes mellitus in a group of late onset PD patients (age >or=70 years). Consecutive late onset PD patients seen in the Department of Neurology, Medical School of Patras, Greece were included in this study. We used very strict criteria to eliminate the possibility of including patients with vascular parkinsonism. Comparisons were made between groups of patients suffering with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and the above-mentioned diseases. One hundred and sixty-seven consecutive late onset PD patients were included in this study. The most common accompanying disorders in our group were hypertension in 31 (18%) of the patients and minor stroke in 20 (12%). The Hoen and Yahr score in late onset IPD patients who suffered from minor stroke, ischemic heart disease or diabetes mellitus was significantly higher when compared with patients without the above disorders. The results clearly suggest that the presence of vascular disease on an IPD patient may aggravate PD severity. In clinical grounds, these findings can be proved significant since early and aggressive prevention of vascular disease and treatment of vascular risk may contribute in controlling symptom severity in PD.",

Cases were validated by board-certified neurologists using source documentation. Case validation was used as the gold standard to compare the diagnosis given by the ED physician.RESULTS: From January 2000 to August 2002, a total of 13,015 patients were screened. Of these, 1,800 were validated as stroke/TIA. Overall sensitivity of the emergency physician for the BASIC-validated diagnosis was 92%, and positive predictive value was 89%. Of the cases that the emergency physician thought were stroke, 11% were validated as no stroke. In multivariable modeling, motor symptoms was an independent predictor of protection from false-negative ED diagnosis of stroke/TIA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.89). Protection from false-positive stroke/TIA diagnosis was predicted by sensory symptoms (OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.66), motor symptoms (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.62), and severe neurologic deficit (OR = 0.33; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78). History of stroke/TIA predicted false-positive stroke diagnosis (OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.40). The majority of disagreements occurred in patients with generalized neurologic or acute medical, nonneurologic syndromes.CONCLUSIONS: Physicians practicing in the ED are sensitive for stroke/TIA diagnosis. The modest positive predictive value argues for a systems approach with neurology support so that proper decisions regarding acute stroke therapy can be made.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Parkinsonism is a group of neurological disorders characterized by extrapiramidal signs. Often, the differential diagnosis between parkinsonism, essential tremor and drug-induced parkinsonism is difficult. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of (123I)-FP-CIT SPECT in patients with movement disorders.PATIENTS AND METHOD: 52 patients were referred from the neurology department to characterize those with parkinsonism. Patients were clinically evaluated and those with Parkinson's disease were assessed using the rating scale Hoehn & Yahr and the UPDRS motor score. Subsequently, a (123I)-FP-CIT SPECT was performed with a qualitative analysis.RESULTS: All patients with essential tremor and drug-induced parkinsonism had a normal SPECT. All patients with parkinsonism displayed SPECT defects, except for four who had a normal SPECT result. Two of them were categorized as vascular parkinsonisms, one patient had a Shy-Drager's syndrome and the another one had probably a Parkinson's disease. The sensitivity and specificity were 90.47% (38/42; CI95%, 81.59%-99.35%) and 100% (10/10; CI95%, 69.15%-100%), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: (123I)-FP-CIT SPECT is an effective tool to study the integrity of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system. Moreover, it permits to characterize the different types of parkinsonism.",

This study includes cases of IM managed in the Departments of Neurology, of two referral hospitals, in India between January 1984 and April 2002. The diagnosis of IM was made when symptoms of meningitis occurred 24 h to 21 days after LP. All the procedures were performed in the peripheral hospitals before they were referred to the two centres. There were 17(63%) women and 10(37%) men. The age range was 19-50 years with a mean age of 31. The precipitating event was spinal anaesthesia for pelvic and intra-abdominal surgeries (Caesarean section 11 cases, hysterectomy three cases, herniorraphy two cases, appendicectomy two cases, anal fissurectomy one case, varicocelectomy one case and hydrocelectomy one case) laminectomy in two and diagnostic myelogram in four patients. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture was positive in six (22%) patients. The organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one case, Staphylococcus aureus in three cases, Acinetobacter spp. in one case and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one case. In five individuals, mycotic aneurysms with subarachnoid haemorrhage due to invasive aspergillosis was documented at autopsy. The mean follow-up was 10.6 months (range 1-18). Seventeen (63%) patients received conventional antibiotics alone, while 10 patients received antibiotics and anti-tuberculous drugs when the meningitis became chronic. The mortality was 36%. The poor prognostic factors were women who underwent Caesarean section (P < 0.04) presence of hemiplegia (P < 0.04) and altered mental status (P < 0.0004). This study shows high morbidity and mortality of IM after LP. Simple aseptic precautions under- taken before the procedure can prevent IM. The urgent need for increasing the awareness among medical personnel in peripheral hospitals of developing countries cannot be over emphasized.",

Intractable diseases in the Department of Neurology rank with those seen in other departments. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most difficult to treat due to the lack of effective drugs. On the other hand, Parkinson disease is the most treatable among intractable diseases in the Department of Neurology with the appearance of several new effective drugs. TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) is effective for ataxic gait in some patients with spinocerebellar degeneration. In the terminal care of intractable diseases in the Department of Neurology, common problems such as disturbances of swallowing, respiration and speaking develop in almost all patients and measures must be taken to treat these disturbances. Artificial respiration must be considered for respiratory distress. Artificial feeding by intubation must be considered for swallowing disturbance. All kinds of communication aids must be considered for speaking difficulties. The medical and nursing care team needs to manage these problems with consideration of the quality of life of the patients and their families as well as the complication of the diseases.",

After brain computerized tomography, eligible patients were treated with intravenous rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg, maximum dose 90 mg) according to an in-hospital protocol corresponding to recommended criteria. Patients were admitted to the acute stroke unit. Safety and clinical outcome were routinely assessed. Recanalization was assessed by serial transcranial Doppler.RESULTS: The study group comprised 16 patients, mean age 61 years (range 47-80 years), male to female ratio 10:6, whose median baseline National Institutes of Health stroke scale was 13 (range 6-24). They were treated within a mean door-to-CT time of 39 minutes (range 17-62 min), door-to-drug time 101 minutes (range 72-150), and stroke onset-to-drug time 151 minutes (range 90-180). There was an early improvement within 24 hours (of > or = 4 points in the NIHSS score) in 7 patients (44%) and no early deteriorations. There were no protocol deviations, no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages, and no major systemic hemorrhage within 36 hours of rt-PA treatment. Three asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of the infarct were noted on routine follow-up brain CT associated with neurologic improvement. Outcome data were comparable to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study.CONCLUSION: Intravenous rt-PA treatment within 3 hours of stroke onset in routine clinical practice in Israel is feasible and appears safe in the setting of a neurology stroke unit and team. Careful implementation of rt-PA therapy for selected patients in Israel is encouraged.",

We have analysed the neurological signs of TS and evaluated the role of levodopa on the symptoms of TS. The data were compared with age-matched patients with Hereditary Progressive Dystonia (HPD) with marked diurnal fluctuation. Neurological examination of 81 drug naive TS patients revealed the clumsiness of rapid alternating pronation-supination movements of the arms and induced rigidity in the contralateral arm, which responded to the oral levodopa, and suggested hypofunction of the nigrostriatal (NS)-DA system. Postural asymmetry or scoliosis and abnormal tilting response suggested the asymmetric involvement of DA. The rotation to the side of less affected DA neuron on stepping with closed eyes suggested DA receptor supersensitivity. The favourable effects of a small dose of levodopa on these signs suggest the existence of DA receptor supersensitivity, because a small dose of levodopa is considered to alleviate the supersensitized DA receptors.",

Twenty one were referred for evaluation of possible epileptic seizures or epilepsy. The median age at first symptoms was 10.5 months (range 3 months to 5 years 5 months). The median age at diagnosis was 24.5 months (range 5 months to 8 years). The median frequency of events was seven times per week, and the median length 2.5 minutes. Events occurred in any situation in 10 children, and in a car seat in 11. Types of behaviour manifested were dystonic posturing in 19, grunting in 10, rocking in 9, eidetic imagery in 7, and sweating in 6. Two children had been previously diagnosed as having definite epilepsy. In nine cases home video was invaluable in allowing confident diagnosis.CONCLUSION: Gratification disorder, otherwise called infantile masturbation, is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of epilepsy and other paroxysmal events in early childhood. Home video recording of events often prevents unnecessary investigations and treatments.",

National support groups contributed 76% and 24% came from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery Headache Clinic.RESULTS: Seventy-two percent were men and 28% women, giving a male to female (M:F) ratio of 2.5:1. Episodic cluster headache (ECH) was recorded in 79% while 21% had chronic cluster headache (CCH). The mean time to diagnosis has dropped from 22 years in the 1960s to 2.6 years in the 1990s, although the mean number of GPs seen before a diagnosis was made remains at three.CONCLUSIONS: While there has been improvement in the time to diagnosis for cluster headache, a number of physicians will be consulted, and better education is likely to reduce the overall patient suffering.",

However the utility of homocysteine-lowering therapy to reduce that risk has not been confirmed by randomized trials.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high doses of folic acid, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and cobalamin (vitamin B12), given to lower total homocysteine levels, reduce the risk of recurrent stroke over a 2-year period compared with low doses of these vitamins.DESIGN: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (September 1996-May 2003).SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 3680 adults with nondisabling cerebral infarction at 56 university-affiliated hospitals, community hospitals, private neurology practices, and Veterans Affairs medical centers across the United States, Canada, and Scotland.INTERVENTIONS: All participants received best medical and surgical care plus a daily multivitamin containing the US Food and Drug Administration's reference daily intakes of other vitamins; patients were randomly assigned to receive once-daily doses of the high-dose formulation (n = 1827), containing 25 mg of pyridoxine, 0.4 mg of cobalamin, and 2.5 mg of folic acid; or the low-dose formulation (n = 1853), containing 200 microg of pyridoxine, 6 microg of cobalamin and 20 microg of folic acid.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent cerebral infarction (primary outcome); coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death (secondary outcomes).RESULTS: Mean reduction of total homocysteine was 2 micromol/L greater in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group, but there was no treatment effect on any end point. The unadjusted risk ratio for any stroke, CHD event, or death was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.1), with chances of an event within 2 years of 18.0% in the high-dose group and 18.6% in the low-dose group. The risk of ischemic stroke within 2 years was 9.2% for the high-dose and 8.8% for the low-dose groups (risk ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3) (P =.80 by log-rank test of the primary hypothesis of difference in ischemic stroke between treatment groups). There was a persistent and graded association between baseline total homocysteine level and outcomes. A 3- micromol/L lower total homocysteine level was associated with a 10% lower risk of stroke (P =.05), a 26% lower risk of CHD events (P<.001), and a 16% lower risk of death (P =.001) in the low-dose group and a nonsignificantly lower risk in the high-dose group by 2% for stroke, 7% for CHD events, and 7% for death.CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, moderate reduction of total homocysteine after nondisabling cerebral infarction had no effect on vascular outcomes during the 2 years of follow-up. However, the consistent findings of an association of total homocysteine with vascular risk suggests that further exploration of the hypothesis is warranted and longer trials in different populations with elevated total homocysteine may be necessary.",

The purpose of this work is to study the epidemiology of the disease in Tunisia, to highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties and also to precise our subsequent needs for substitutive medication.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have conducted a retrospective survey of the hospital wards that were susceptible to take care of patients having Gaucher's disease. These wards are the paediatric, neonatology, internal medicine, haematology, neurology and cardiology wards.RESULTS: In this study we have observed 27 cases of Gaucher's disease over a period of 18 years (1983-2001). The age at onset ranges from birth to 73 years of age, with an average age of 14.5 years. According to the age at onset and the clinical presentation, we classify our patients into: 20 cases of type 1 (74%), three cases of type 2 (12%), and three cases of type 3 (12%), and one case of unspecified type.Gaucher's disease type 1: The age at onset ranged from 10 months to 73 years with an average of 19 years. The main clinical signs that we have observed were splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, pallor, haemorrhagic appearance and also osteoporosis and bone pain observed in 40% of the cases. The diagnosis was based on histology showing the Gaucher's cells in various tissues while the diagnosis obtained by the dosage of glucocerebrosidase took place only in 50% of the cases. The treatment has always been symptomatic (analgesics, transfusion). A splenectomy was performed in 47% of the cases and none of the patients received a specific treatment. The follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 18 years with an average follow-up of 4 years. Among the 12 patients having a follow-up of at least 1 year, we have noticed an improvement after splenectomy in three cases, a stability in three cases and two worsening cases dealing mainly with bone problems. One patient aged 73 died from respiratory problem and three were lost to follow-up. Gaucher's disease type 2: We have observed three cases of Gaucher's disease type 2 diagnosed at 1 day, 45 days and 3 months of age. The visceral manifestations were serious and the neurological features included seizures, hypertony, ocular-nerve palsies and psychometric decline. The three patients died. Gaucher's disease type 3: Three patients were probably suffering from Gaucher's disease type 3 with visceral manifestations observed at the ages of 9 months, 1 year and 3 years, and also neurological signs observed at respective ages of 2.5 and 3 years. Two patients died and the remaining one was lost to follow-up.CONCLUSION: Gaucher's disease is not exceptional in Tunisia. Type 1 is by far the most common one. We have noticed some insufficiency in the diagnosis as the glucocerebrosidase enzymatic dosage was performed only in 50% of the cases as well as therapeutic insufficiency with no prescription of the specific treatment.",

Illnesses and those who suffer them are to be found throughout his works. Many neurological diseases, such as apoplexy, melancholy, headaches or epilepsy, appear quite often in his plays.

This symptom, historically recognised as a static symptom in this disease, is not surrendering of treatment. Results of some new studies suggest, that the symptom of emotional blunting usually changes in the course of illness and during medical treatment. Thus, it is of prognostic significance.AIM: The aim of study is an assessment of the intensity of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.METHOD: In the study, patients of both sexes treated in the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw were examined. Seventy patients with schizophrenia were examined five times: before, during and after 8-week pharmacological treatment. The clinical status of patients was assessed by means of RSEB (which estimates presence and severity of emotional blunting); PANSS (which estimates all psychopathological symptoms); and CGI (general clinical condition of patients).RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed a high level of emotional blunting in the investigated group. Also, there is a statistical significant correlation between the emotional blunting and the general patients' condition; decrease of emotional blunting during pharmacological treatment improves the results of CGI. Severity of emotional blunting before treatment is a predictive factor of its severity after treatment. There were no significant associations between the emotional blunting and other analysed factors: age, gender, number of hospitalizations, duration of illness, dose of drugs, global result of PANSS and severity of depressive symptoms.",

Blood samples were obtained by phlebotomy. Serum and salivary lamotrigine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate correlations. Six patients' results were omitted due to the lack of a serum or saliva specimen or clearly erroneous results, leaving 31 patients for analysis. There was a strong correlation between the serum results reported by two reference laboratories (coefficient of correlation [r] = 0.988). The correlations between salivary and serum lamotrigine concentrations were similar for reference laboratory A (r = 0.81) and reference laboratory B (r = 0.84). Saliva:serum concentration ratios ranged from 0.41-1.26 (mean +/- SD 0.62 +/- 0.19) for reference laboratory A and from 0.40-1.19 ((mean +/- SD 0.64 +/- 0.18) for reference laboratory B.CONCLUSION: There is a good correlation between salivary and serum concentrations for lamotrigine. However, there is wide interpatient variability in the saliva:serum ratio. The data suggest that salivary monitoring may play a role in the monitoring of lamotrigine for adult and pediatric patients.",

Patients Fifteen patients with clinically diagnosed relapsing sensorimotor CIDP.INTERVENTIONS: Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin or prednisone.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Electrodiagnostic studies.RESULTS: All patients had electrodiagnostic abnormalities in at least 3 nerves with possible partial conduction block or demyelinating range abnormalities in at least 1 nerve. The diagnostic sensitivities of 5 published CIDP criteria were as follows: the Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force (40%), Saperstein et al (47%), Nicolas et al (53%), Hughes et al for the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment Group (60%), and Thaisetthawatkul et al (70%).CONCLUSIONS: Current electrodiagnostic criteria for CIDP are insensitive and may fail to diagnose the condition in a substantial number of patients.

This study examines the effect of immunotherapy on generalization rates in ocular myasthenia patients who are acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive.METHODS: Retrospective record review of 34 patients from three university-based hospitals with neurology and neuro-ophthalmology services in Australia. In all patients, positive AChR antibodies were recorded, the initial symptoms were purely ocular, and all had at least 2 years of follow-up. The patients who developed generalized myasthenia gravis were compared with those who remained purely ocular.RESULTS: There were 21 patients who developed generalized myasthenia gravis. Of these 21, only 2 (9.5%) had received prior immunotherapy. Among the 13 patients whose symptoms remained purely ocular, 10 (76.9%) had received prior immunotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, most of the patients who progressed from ocular myasthenia to generalized myasthenia had not received prior immunotherapy. This study adds weight to the call for a prospective trial of early immunotherapy in patients with ocular myasthenia.",

Although various electroencephalographic alterations have been described in these patients, their pathological significance has not been determined. There have also been reports of children with neuropsychological and language disorders having epileptiform anomalies in the EEG recording.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a study of 15 children, with no history of seizures, who had been referred to Child Neurology for treatment and who satisfied the criteria for ADHD according to the DSM IV and the ADHRS (attention deficit/hyperactivity rating scale).RESULTS: The EEG recording in the waking state showed significant anomalies in two of our patients (acute spike and wave paroxysmal activity in the left temporoparietal region and spike wave discharges during hyperventilation). The polysomnographic study revealed specific alterations in four children. There was a continuous spike wave trace during slow sleep (CSWS) in one case, paroxysmal activity (slow acute waves, spikes) in the temporoparietal region with secondary generalization or transmission (two cases), and frequent generalized paroxysmal discharges of slow acute waves in all phases of sleep (one case).CONCLUSIONS: The neurophysiological disorders observed in some of our patients could make it necessary to consider performing a night time polysomnographic study in certain cases of ADHD.",

Despite his importance in the field of neurology, few biographical details have been recorded about Hunt's life. One of the authors of this report recently located Hunt's daughter. This biographical sketch was based on interviews conducted with her and review of documents in her possession, including letters written by Hunt.

Although the pathogenesis of CCMs is not well known, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been suggested as a possible mediating factor.OBJECTIVES: To report CCMs showing rapid progression over a short period and to investigate these biological characteristics.DESIGN: Experimental study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center, neurology department. Patient A 40-year-old man was admitted because of a left-sided numbness, vertigo, and ataxia, which were attributed to a pontine hemorrhage. He had experienced a left-sided weakness 6 months before admission, and thereafter had complained of intermittent headache. Serial brain magnetic resonance images showed multiple intracerebral microhemorrhages throughout the cerebral hemispheres. A biopsy of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of CCM.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We investigated the expression of VEGF by immunohistochemistry of the biopsy specimen. Dynamic patterns of CCMs, obtained with spin-echo magnetic resonance images with gradient-echo sequences, were compared with serial serum VEGF concentrations, determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry of the specimen displayed increased VEGF expression. Serial magnetic resonance images during 7 months showed dynamic signal changes of the preexisting lesions and 15 de novo formations in many cortices. The VEGF level in serum increased during this dynamic period and became normal during the steady and resolving stages.CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral cavernous malformations can be progressively deteriorating. The endothelial proliferation induced by VEGF is likely to be an important aspect of the pathogenetic mechanisms of CCMs.",

At the same time, we aimed to compare this group of patients with another group of children who were considered to be healthy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients psychological development was evaluated using developmental landmarks from the Observational Scale of Development (OSD), which provides a percentage of elements acquired in different areas. Behaviour was evaluated by the observational recording of particular patterns of behaviour. The neurological study was based on a detailed neonatal examination, performed by people from the Child Neurology Section at our hospital, and which took into account the different behaviours displayed by the NI: reactive, grasping, communicative and affective.RESULTS: Findings show significant differences both in the psychological and neurological variables studied. They show how, generally speaking, healthy infants score higher in the areas of development that were evaluated than children suffering from heart disease. Likewise, lower average scores were observed in heart disease patients who require an early intervention, as compared with those who will be submitted to surgery later on. From the neurological point of view, a number of significant differences were found in their muscular activity.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis, a groundbreaker in the study of infants suffering from heart disease before their surgical intervention, shows how newborn infants who have been submitted to surgery in the neonatal period present a significant degree of hypotonia, a certain frailness and retardation in their motor development.",

The pathogenic theory that most suitably explains its origin is the vascular one, mainly linked to cerebral hemodynamic abnormalities. The techniques most frequently used in cerebral hemodynamic evaluation (PET and SPECT) are expensive and not widespread. Transcranial Doppler instead is cheaper and much more widespread.OBJECTIVE: Our aim has been to show whether transcranial Doppler is a useful tool for cerebral hemodynamic evaluation in leukoaraiosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have prospectively included 116 patients aged 60-90 who came to the Neurology department with unspecific complaints such as dizziness or mild headache. Patients with recent history of stroke or moderate to severe cognitive impairment were excluded.RESULTS: Mean age was 74.4 +/- 6.3 years old. The prevalence of leukoaraiosis was 68.7%. Leukoaraiosis was significantly correlated with older age, lacunar infarctions, past history of stroke, cognitive impairment and to lower systolic and diastolic velocities in middle cerebral artery (MCA) and higher pulsatility index. Multivariate analysis only retained the lower diastolic velocity in MCA in the model.CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial Doppler can detect hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with leukoaraiosis and is therefore a very useful technique for the evaluation of this entity.",

The reactivity and antioxidative potency of two selected JSAKs and their parent nitroxyl against reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined in vitro, in a cell-free gamma-radiolysis and in model Fenton-type reaction systems and compared with those of deprenyl, the investigated member of adjunct therapies in clinical neurology. The efficiency of JSAKs to suppress the oxidative degradation of a model target (deoxyribose), deprenyl and dopamine, caused by hydroxyl radical (*OH) was also investigated. The data demonstrated that the novel compounds, JSAKs, can act as promising antioxidants and protectors of targets against ROS toxicity, thus, providing a sound chemical basis for further comparative investigations of their activity in vivo. The findings were discussed from a mechanistic point of view as well as in terms of the structure-dependent, comprehensive properties of JSAKs as dual-function compounds: antioxidants and anti-apoptotic propargylamines. The novel class of N-propargylamine nitroxyls, JSAKs, may have potential implications for the experimental therapies of Parkinson's disease, where ROS mediate deleterious effects, because these compounds have an ability to either block or reduce the progression of neurotoxic cascade of brain damage.",

Until recently, confirmation of the diagnosis of MS has generally required the demonstration of clinical activity that is disseminated in both time and space. Nevertheless, with the advent of MRI techniques, occult disease activity can be demonstrated in 50 to 80% of patients at the time of the first clinical presentation. Prospective studies have shown that the presence of such lesions predicts future conversion to clinically definite (CD) MS. Indeed, in a young to middle-aged adult with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), once alternative diagnoses are excluded at baseline, the finding of three or more white matter lesions on a T2-weighted MRI scan (especially if one of these lesions is located in the periventricular region) is a very sensitive predictor (>80%) of the subsequent development of CDMS within the next 7 to 10 years. Moreover, the presence of two or more gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions at baseline and the appearance of either new T2 lesions or new Gd enhancement on follow-up scans are also highly predictive of the subsequent development of CDMS in the near term. By contrast, normal results on MRI at the time of clinical presentation makes the future development of CDMS considerably less likely.",

Of 77 Clostridium difficile isolates obtained from 77 patients during the 1-year investigation period, 30 were A-/B+ and 47 were toxin A-positive, toxin B-positive (A+/B+). By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, 23 of the 30 A-/B+ strains were outbreak-related, suggesting nosocomial spread of a single type of bacterium, which mainly affected patients in the wards of respiratory medicine, hematology and neurology. Using regression analysis, three factors were found to be associated with infection by A-/B+ isolates: (i) exposure to antineoplastic agents ( P=0.01, odds ratio [OR]=5.1), (ii) the use of nasal feeding tubes ( P=0.008, OR=5.2), and (iii) assignment to a certain internal medicine ward ( P=0.05, OR=3.0). Between patients with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea caused by A-/B+ strains and those with A+/B+ strains, no statistically significant difference was found in body temperature, serum concentration of C-reactive protein, leukocyte count in whole blood, frequency of diarrhea, or type of underlying disease. These results indicate that A-/B+ strains of Clostridium difficile can cause intestinal infection in humans and they spread nosocomially in the same manner as A+/B+ strains.",

After resolution of paraparesis, dynamic studies of the cervical spine revealed translational instability of C3 over C4. The patient underwent segment fusion by intervertebral cage insertion and plate fixation.RESULTS: The patient had recovered almost completely from tetraparesis under conservative treatment. The postoperative course was uneventful. Solid bony fusion of the C3/C4 motion segment was obtained.CONCLUSION: Despite normal cervical alignment, the lack of bony lesions and neurological recovery, magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic studies may reveal marked translational cervical motion segment instability requiring segment fusion in order to prevent ongoing damage of the spinal cord.",

In this study, expression of various stress proteins in the Alzheimer-diseased choroid plexus (CP) was assessed immunohistochemically. We observed decreased HO-1 immunoreactivity in the AD CP, commensurate with our earlier report of suppressed HO-1 protein levels in AD cerebrospinal fluid (Schipper et al., Neurology 54:1297-1304, 2000). Heat shock protein (HSP) 90 was up-regulated in the AD CP relative to controls. There was a trend towards increased expression of HSP60, a mitochondrial stress protein; this is compatible with mitochondrial pathology recently documented in AD CP. Up-regulation of HSP90, a steroid receptor chaperone, in the AD CP may indicate abnormal hormone receptor expression in this secretory tissue. Glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78 and 94 immunostaining was diminished in AD CP, implicating possible derangements in glucose or calcium homeostasis. Oxidative stress, per se, is probably not responsible for our observations because: i) there were no noticeable differences in the expression of HSP 70, ubiquitin, and alpha-B crystallin in the AD CP; and ii) augmentation, rather than the noted suppression, of HO-1 immunoreactivity would have been expected.",

All the infants were prospectively followed until the 3rd year of age at the Clinic for Neurology and Psychiatry for Children and Youth in order to estimate their neurological development and to diagnose the occurrence of persistent neurological disorders. All the infants were analyzed by their gestational age and Apgar score in the 1st and the 5th minute of life. They were all examined neurologically and by ultrasonography in the first week of life and, repeatedly, at the age of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, as well as in the 24th month of life. They were treated by the standard methods for this disease. Finally, all the infants were examined neurologically and by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in their 3rd year of age. On the basis of neurological finding infants were divided into 3 groups: infants with normal neurological finding, infants with mild neurological symptomatology, and infants with severe neurological disorders.RESULTS: It was shown that neurological finding, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain positively correlated with the later neurological development of the infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.CONCLUSION: Only the combined use of these techniques had full diagnostic and prognostic significance, emphasizing that the integrative approach was very important in the diagnosis of brain lesions in infants.",

Siriraj Stroke Scoring was applied. Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and transient ischemic attacks were excluded from the study. The findings were recorded, compared and statistically analyzed.RESULTS: Out of 100 patients 45 were male and 55 female with mean age of 59 years. Sixty-two patients had hypertension, 36 patients had one or more atheroma markers (diabetes, coronary artery disease and claudication). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 98 mmHg with range of 60-140 mmHg and mean systolic blood pressure of 163 mmHg with the range of 90-240 mmHg. Forty-eight patients had cerebral infarction, 36 had cerebral hemorrhage while 16 were borderline cases on the basis of Siriraj stroke scoring. CT brain showed 56 and 39 patients had cerebral infarction and haemorrhage respectively while 5 of CT scans were normal. The sensitivity and specificity of SSS for cerebral infarction was 71 and 85 respectively and for intracerebral haemorrhage, it was 73 and 90 respectively. The positive predictive values of SSS for cerebral infarction and haemorrhage were 87% and 83 respectively.CONCLUSION: The siriraj stroke scoring system is a valid and specific scoring system for the diagnosis of acute supratentorial stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage.",

No study is known on this subject in Dutch general hospitals. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of the use of physical restraints and side-rails and factors associated with restraint and side-rail use in a Dutch teaching hospital. On two acute care wards (internal medicine and neurology) 208 consecutively admitted patients were personally observed for the use of side-rails in February 2001. The use of restraints was abstracted from the nursing records.RESULTS: Of the patients 34% at least one time had side-rails raised, and 9% was subjected to physical restraints at some point during hospitalisation. In the logistic model, the neurology ward (OR: 4; 95% CI: 2-10), age of 80 or over (OR 12; 95% CI 3-51), stroke (OR 7; 95% CI 2-24), disorientation (OR: 9; 95% CI: 3-29) and restlessness or agitation (OR: 68; 95% CI: 7-596) were found to be independently associated with use of side-rails. For the use of restraints restlessness or agitation (OR: 125; 95% CI: 18-856) was found to be an independent factor. Differences in study design make comparisons between institutions and countries difficult.",

Patients displaying neurological symptoms capable of being diagnostically tested. The total number of patients-samples examined was 43 (23 males and 20 females; mean age 43 y, range 1-78 y). Five patients groups were studied: a control group, meningitis, dementia, polyneuropathy-motorneuron disease, and acute cerebral infarction group (ACV). S-100 and NSE concentrations were measured by immunoradiometric procedures.RESULTS: Highest S-100 median levels in CSF were found in dementia and ACV group, with elevate concentrations in meningitis groups. The increased S-100 levels in these groups was significant compared with control group (Mann-Withney U test). For NSE concentrations, there is a significant differences between dementia group and control group. No other significant differences were found between groups. There were positive correlation between S-100 levels and total protein.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that S-100 and NSE can be a sensitive marker of brain damage in different neurological disorders. However, levels must be considered individually, since these concentrations depend on several factors, such as age, severity of brain damage or interval between the onset of brain damage and the taking of the sample.",

The chief variables used in the study were disability, QOL and the overall evaluation of their state of health. The remaining variables employed included demographic variables (age, sex, skin colour) and clinical variables involved in the bouts of migraine (with or without aura, pain location, type of pain, length of the bouts, presence of associated symptoms, presence of precipitating factors and their number, intensity of the bouts and the number of days with headache). The Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire (MIDAS) was used to evaluate disability, while QOL was measured with the Headache Needs Assessment survey (HANA).RESULTS: The mean total score on the MIDAS was 40.8, and 58.6% of the patients were in grade IV disability. The mean number of days with headache over a three month period was 32.25 and the mean headache intensity was 8.50. The mean score on the HANA was 76.37. The factors associated with disability were the number of days with headache and comorbidity with high blood pressure, whereas their QOL was linked to the number of days with headache, the intensity of the pain and to the female sex.",

The incidence is higher in the elderly and in patients with coronary artery disease. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is an important diagnostic tool that allows its detection.OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of patients with ischemic stroke and echocardiographic diagnosis of aortic debris.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the group of patients with debris diagnosis in 209 TEE performed between 01/01/99 and 31/05/02, in 835 consecutive ischemic events. The information was collected from the Stroke Database of the Neurology Department of Policlinica Bancaria.RESULTS: TEE was accomplished in 25% of all assisted events. The mean age was 66.56 years (SD 11.22). In 30 studies (14%) aortic debris was detected. In this group of patients, 26 men and 4 women, was also found: plaques grade IV 60%, left atrial dilatation 40% and spontaneous echo contrast 20%. The most frequent risk factors were hypertension, dislipemia and smoking, with no significative difference compared to the group without debris. 40% had a prior cerebrovascular event. They presented with clinical subtype LACI 53%, PACI 27%, POCI 17%. 63% of patients had lacunar infarct (53% anterior and 10% posterior).CONCLUSION: The contribution of TTE for detection of embolic sources is relevant. A high percentage of the population with echocardiographic diagnosis of aortic debris, had a lacunar infarct, defined radiologically and by clinical features.",

It is characterised by progressive demyelination of the cerebral white matter and adrenal insufficiency. The most important change that occurs is the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). The authors describe a patient whom the initial phenotype was Addison disease only (AO). With 21 years old he developed neurological complaints and the electrophysiological and neuroradiological studies performed, confirmed the phenotypic change from AO to pure Adrenomyeloneuropathy. Less than 2 years later, the clinical condition worsened and the magnetic resonance performed confirmed cerebral involvement by the disease. The authors point out the need to determine the levels of VLCFAs in all men with adrenal insufficiency. They also put much emphasis on the endocrinology and neurology following of any patient with ALD because of the possibility of a phenotypic change to occur.",

These additional sites are helpful when patients expect results for both their illness and their wrinkles; whereas some patients will show improvement with the classic treatment for wrinkles, additional sites may be required.METHODS: : Ten patients suffering from migraine, as diagnosed through the criteria proposed by the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society, were selected. We used easily recognizable acupuncture sites for the injection of botulinum toxin.RESULTS: : There was significant improvement in patients with acupuncture site-guided botulinum toxin injection. It showed to be a safe and effective therapy for migraine.CONCLUSION: : There are alternative sites besides those used for the treatment of expression lines, which bring forth an improvement of migraine.",

Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan, is located between 42 and 46 degrees, and the people have ancestors from various parts of Japan, since this island was reclaimed about 130 years ago. Three major neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis(MS), spinocerebellar degeneration(SCD) and Parkinson disease (PD), were discussed on the bases of Hokkaido island. We proved the existence of definite north-south gradient of MS, prevalence rate of 8.6 in Tokachi, Hokkaido, compared with 1-2 in the southern island. SCD, especially hereditary SCD, such as SCA1, SCA2 and SCA14 were reported from Hokkaido. The epidemiological studies of PD showed the prevalence rate of 104.6 at Iwamizawa, Hokkaido in 2000, and we proposed the prevalence rate of PD was close to those of Western countries under the collaborative works with Yonago, Kyoto, and Kagoshima by 2001. Neurology, and its specialization and training programs were also discussed to propose the importance of Neurology in Japan.",

Preferences for GCSE refractory to two AEDs (RSE) varied: 43% would give phenobarbital, 19% would give one of three continuous-infusion (cIV) AEDs (pentobarbital, midazolam, propofol), and 16% would give IV valproic acid. About half indicated \"burst suppression\" (56%) and half indicated \"elimination of seizures\" (41%) as the titration goal for cIV-AED therapy. About half (42%) would add a new cIV-AED, and the other half (41%) would not add another agent to treat electrographic SE refractory to four AEDs.DISCUSSION: In accordance with published trials and general guidelines, neurologists most often use lorazepam followed by phenytoin or fosphenytoin as first-line and second-line therapies for GCSE. There is no consensus for third-line or fourth-line treatment for RSE. The treatment of RSE needs to be studied in a large, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial.",

Recent investigations using diffusion imaging have revealed increased apparent diffusion coefficient in perihematomal tissue. We report brain tissue abnormalities beyond the visibly abnormal region ipsilateral and contralateral to the hematoma. This preliminary effort should generate meaningful clinical prognostic indicators for moderate size hemorrhages in large scale studies.METHODS: Using the neurology patient encounter database at a tertiary care hospital, we retrospectively identified patients who presented with acute focal neurologic deficits, had CT scans of the head that confirmed spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, and had a MR images obtained within the first 6 hr to 30 days postictus. The regions identified as targets of this investigation were the hemorrhage and surrounding T2 signal intensity abnormality and the visibly normal supratentorial cerebral tissue.RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were admitted during a period of 25 months. Fifteen patients met the criteria for the study. Elevated whole brain diffusion was shown as early as 6 hr after intracranial hemorrhage. This increase in diffusion was comparable in both hemispheres. Diffusion values in the lesion (hematoma plus T2 signal intensity abnormality) increased slowly with peak increases noted 2 to 3 days after the ictus.CONCLUSION: Diffuse early cerebral response occurs in normal appearing brain tissue both ipsilateral and contralateral to the visibly abnormal hematoma, manifested by increased apparent diffusion coefficient. This response is present before the local response is fully developed. Supratentorial intracranial hemorrhage results in an early diffuse brain response with increased apparent diffusion coefficient in normal appearing brain.",

In this period, mammographic studies were made in 9169 women included into a breast cancer-risk group. Of them 1370 young female patients with well-developed glandular tissue that makes mammographic diagnosis of presumed masses difficult underwent breast ultrasonography. Abnormalities were found in 6092 (66.44%) patients. Breast cancer and nodal benign masses (including cysts and fibroadenomas) were detected in 278 (3.03%) and 669 (7.30%) women, respectively. The detection rates of unpalpable breast malignant and benign masses carcinomas were 0.4 and 3.03%, respectively.

The International Headache Society (IHS) set out the currently used criteria in 1988; 14 years later it has just put forward a number of modifications.AIMS: Our aim was to test the comprehensiveness, sensitivity and specificity of both the current and the newly proposed diagnostic criteria in Primary Health Care (PHC), where patients must be screened properly before referral to Neurology services.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 74 cases of M and 44 of TH attended in two PHC centres in Seville, in the course of a study about the psychological aspects of headaches. The doctors used a semi structured clinical interview based on the IHS criteria to carry out diagnoses.RESULTS: The comprehensiveness of the system was 100%; sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic criteria were, generally speaking, appropriate and one point highlighted was the intensity of the pain and the fact that it was aggravated by physical activity. Discriminating analysis correctly classified 94.1% of the cases according to the 1988 IHS criteria and 90.7% according to the IHS proposals from 2002, although in the latter case an extra criterion was included in the discrimination.DISCUSSION: As shown by different studies, diagnosis carried out by professionals who are well trained in the use of the current IHS criteria is perfectly valid. The present proposals for modification seem to reorganise the classification more efficiently, since they include chronic migraine and also divide episodic TH into infrequent and frequent bouts. These new proposals are now beginning their test period in different fields of application.",

Six months later the patients were reassessed clinically and those still with chorea (20 cases) were asked to undergo the genetic tests for Huntington's disease and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy.RESULTS: There were 9 cases of focal dyskinesias, 18 of hemichorea, and 24 of generalised chorea; onset was acute in 17, subacute in 27, and insidious in seven. Analysis permitted classification as follows: vascular-related (21 cases); vasculitis (1 case); hypoxia (2 cases); drug-induced (7 cases); AIDS-related (5 cases), borreliosis (1 case); Sydenham's chorea (1 case); hyperglycaemia (2 cases); hyponatraemia (2 cases); Huntington's disease (HD) (5 cases) and acanthocytosis (1 case). In 3 patients neither etiological factors nor neuroradiological alterations were found.CONCLUSIONS: Although a convincing concordance between choreic signs and neuroradiological findings was possible in 4 patients only, it was possible to assign an aetiology in most cases with vascular related causes the most frequent and metabolic factors often participating. Huntington's disease is not unusual as a cause of sporadic choreas. HIV infection is an emerging cause of chorea and AIDS-related disease should be considered in young patients presenting without a family history of movement disorders. We emphasize the importance of follow-up to identify persistent chorea for which genetic testing is mandatory.",

Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) was measured by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine which variables were associated with QOLIE-31 total and subcomponent scores.RESULTS: Mean age of the patient population was 37.9 (SD 15.8) years; 43.5% were females; 51.8% did not have a partner; 39.1% had some university education; 82.6% were unemployed. Of 115 epileptic patients 83.3% had partial, and 16.7% had generalised seizures. Overall, 32.2% of patients were seizure free, and 28.7% experienced more than 10 seizures over the past year. The variables that most strongly predicted a lower QOLIE-31 total score were a low education level, high seizure frequency, and long duration of epilepsy. The QOLIE-31 all subcomponent scores correlated strongly with seizure frequency. Advanced age was a significant predictor for a low overall quality of life, energy/fatigue, and cognitive scores. Female sex was the factor that significantly predicted a low seizure worry score. Education level strongly correlated with overall quality of life, and cognitive and social functioning scores.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical factors such as high seizure frequency and long duration of epilepsy had a significant influence on HRQL. Advanced age, female sex, and a low education level were the demographic factors that correlated strongly with low quality of life scores.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the differences in the characteristics of CV risk in women with respect to men, and if there are differences in the treatment between men and women.PATIENTS AND METHOD: We collected the data from CV high-risk patients from Cardiology, Internal Medicine, Neurology, Endocrinology and Primary Care. We considered high-risk patients those with coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes plus one or more additional risk factor. Parameters recorded were age, gender, glucose, glycated haemoglobin, blood pressure, smoking habit, lipid profile, microalbuminuria, and pharmacological treatment. We performed an age-adjusted, multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Out of 5,207 patients, 1,307 were considered as high risk (56.1% men and 43.9% women). The median age was 67.3 years (66.1 y men, 68.8 y women). In the coronary heart disease group, women received less antiplatelet therapy (69.4% vs 80.4%; OR = 1.592) and less cholesterol-lowering agents (despite higher prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, 52.8% vs 39.1%). In diabetics patients with additional risk factors, women received less antiplatelet therapy (42.9% vs 36.6%, OR = 1.486) and lipid-lowering therapy (53.5% vs 41.4%), and more diuretics (41.4% vs 26.5%; OR = 0.588).CONCLUSIONS: There is a different profile of CV risk in women, with more diabetes and less smoking habit. In this study, a trend to less treat high-risk women with respect to high-risk men is observed.",

This effect of L-dopa on plasma homocysteine is accentuated under conditions of impaired homocysteine metabolism such as folate deficiency.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of L-dopa administration and B-vitamin status on plasma homocysteine concentrations in humans with PD.METHODS: Plasma homocysteine, folate, vitamin B(12), and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) concentrations were determined in 40 individuals diagnosed with idiopathic PD who were being treated as outpatients at the Boston University Medical Center Neurology Clinic. Twenty of the patients were on L-dopa therapy (treatment group) and 20 were L-dopa-naive (control group).RESULTS: The mean plasma homocysteine concentration was higher in the treatment group than in the controls (p = 0.018). Plasma homocysteine was correlated with plasma folate, vitamin B(12), and PLP concentrations in the treatment group (p <or= 0.007) but not in the controls.CONCLUSION: L-Dopa can cause hyperhomocysteinemia in PD patients, the extent of which is influenced by B-vitamin status. The B-vitamin requirements necessary to maintain normal plasma homocysteine concentrations are higher in L-dopa-treated patients than in those not on L-dopa therapy. B-Vitamin supplements may be warranted for PD patients on L-dopa therapy.",

Cerebral revascularization procedures require total occlusion of the cranial arteries for a while. End-to-side anastomoses with partial lateral clipping were done in 20 cadaver arteries and then, in one rat common carotid artery. The results of the study were compared with the current cerebrovascular bypass procedures on a theoretical basis and possible clinical implications of the method were suggested. All the anastomoses were found to be open. As conclusions; 1) End-to-side anastomosis with partial lateral clipping and along with this technique the maintenance of blood flow in the target vessel during the anastomosis procedure are experimentally possible. 2) Although the available aneurysm clips may be used in the bigger vessels (> 2.5 mm), currently, the exclusive clips for the technique are not available commercially. 3) Further clinical implications of the technique may be investigated.",

Fifty-five trauma patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] > or = 24 and Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] < or = 8) were classified by radiography, computer tomography, ultrasound, and neurology as TBI without multiple trauma (n = 23), TBI with multiple trauma (n = 23), or multiple trauma without TBI (n = 9). S 100 B was measured initially after trauma and daily for a maximum of 21 days. Both survivors and nonsurvivors had markedly increased S 100 B initially. All survivors returned to normal or moderately increased S 100 B levels within the first 48 h after trauma. In contrast, all nonsurvivors of isolated TBI had S 100 B values that either increased consistently or dropped and then increased again 48 h after the initial increase after trauma. There was no relationship between localization, extent, or severity of TBI and S 100 B. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and calculation of the area under the curve (AUC), S 100 B is equally accurate for mortality prediction at 24, 48, and 72 h after trauma and is most accurate >84 h after trauma. Sensitivity/specificity for mortality prediction are more accurate in TBI without multiple trauma (AUC 0.802-0.971) than in TBI with multiple trauma (AUC 0.693-0.783). Thus, though S 100 B may be a reliable marker of brain damage in TBI without multiple trauma 24 h after trauma and thereafter, it appears to be less reliable in TBI with multiple trauma.",

To find evidence for this hypothesis, we aimed to detect structural changes in the hypothalamus and/or hypocretin projection areas of patients with narcolepsy.DESIGN: We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM), an unbiased MRI morphometric method with a high sensitivity for subtle changes in gray and white matter volumes.SETTING: Image acquisition was carried out in the department of Radiology at Leiden University Medical Center; image post-processing was performed in the Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London.PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen narcoleptic patients were studied, all having cataplexy and typical findings on Multiple Sleep Latency Testing. All patients were HLA-DQB1*0602 positive and hypocretin-1 deficient. The control group consisted of 15 age and sex matched healthy subjects.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We found no differences in global gray or white matter volumes between patients and controls. Furthermore, regional gray or white matter volumes in the hypothalamus and hypocretin projection areas did not differ between patients and controls.CONCLUSIONS: VBM failed to show structural changes in the brains of patients with narcolepsy. This suggests that narcolepsy either is associated with microscopic changes undetectable by VBM or that functional abnormalities of hypocretin neurons are not associated with structural correlates.",

There are now four approved therapies for secondary prevention of cerebrovascular events. As these agents exhibit their effects through different pathways, physicians must choose antiplatelet agents based on other factors.DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed charts of neurology patients diagnosed with non-fatal ischemic stroke or TIA at IU from January 1, 1997 to August 31, 2001. Patients were excluded if: discharge diagnosis was not non-fatal ischemic stroke or TIA, they were enrolled in clinical trials, or were placed on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Patients' antiplatelet agents at discharge were reviewed to determine if specific factors led to the choice of antiplatelet agent.RESULTS: A total of 177 patients experienced non-fatal ischemic strokes or TIAs. Of these, 74 were not on prior antiplatelet therapy and 103 were on antiplatelet agents prior to admission. For patients not on therapy, aspirin was the most commonly prescribed agent, with a trend for low-dose aspirin. For patients already on an antiplatelet agent, typically the dose of aspirin was increased or combination therapy initiated.CONCLUSION: Our experience supports the use of aspirin as a first-line agent for secondary prevention in cerebrovascular disease. For antiplatelet-nai;ve patients, low-dose aspirin is the most frequently used agent. For patients previously on antiplatelet agents, aspirin dosage is increased or clopidogrel is added. High-dose aspirin and ticlopidine use is no longer favored.",

Retrospective review of GP referral letters via this system and comparison to Department of Health referral guidelines. Review of corresponding casenotes to determine the actual neurological diagnosis. Identification of patients with CNS/brain tumours diagnosed independently of this system from a local CNS cancer register.RESULTS: Over a 3-month period pre-implementation of the referral system, of 12 patients referred as emergencies, none had CNS/brain cancer. Forty-three patients were referred via this system over a 9-month period to neurology departments of a teaching hospital and a district general hospital. Thirty per cent of the referrals did not follow the Department of Health guidelines. Only 9% actually had CNS tumours (two astrocytomas, two cerebral metastases). The remainder were diagnosed with chronic daily headache (10), epilepsy (5), migraine (3), demyelination (2), essential tremor (2), other (17). During this period at least 69 neurological cancers were identified independently of the 2-week system.CONCLUSION: These guidelines may increase diagnostic precision if adhered to rigidly. Inappropriate referrals have extended already lengthy outpatient waiting times in other specialities. We suggest early re-consideration of these guidelines and further study for earlier identification of CNS cancer.",

Even though its indication in patients with stroke is still controversial, its use has contributed to the identification of potential embolic stroke sources.OBJECTIVE: To describe the transesophageal echocardiographic findings in ischemic stroke patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed case series of 162 TEE performed on a total of 576 ischemic events dated between 01/01/99 to 01/05/01. The required information was collected prospectively in the Stroke Data Bank of the Neurology Department at Policl nico Bancario in Buenos Aires.RESULTS: TEE was carried out in 162 (28.1%) cases. Of theses cases 13% belonged to the clinical subtype TACI, 37% to PACI, 17% to POCI, and 37% to LACI subtype. Pathologic findings corresponded to cardiac level: spontaneous contrast in 29% of the cases, and to aortic level: plaques grade IV in 34% and debris in 13% of the cases. According to the etiology of ischemic stroke, 67 patients had been registered under the diagnosis of lacunar infarct (60 in the anterior region and 7 in the posterior region), 93 had been diagnosed medium and grand artery infarct (73 in the anterior region and 29 in the posterior region), and 2 had remained unclassified. Emboligenic sources were found in 69.5% of TACI, 65% of PACI, 52% of POCI, and 53% of LACI.CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of aortic artheroembolic pathology was detected in the population under study. However, spontaneous contrast was the echocardiographic phenomenon more frequently reported. It is to be pointed out the presence of potential cardiac and/or aortic emboligenic sources in 48% of the population with lacunar infarct",

Children with agenesis of the corpus callosum were identified in a comprehensive computerized database of all patients seen in a single pediatric neurology practice over an 11-year interval. Medical records were then systematically reviewed. Twenty-four children with agenesis of the corpus callosum were identified of a total of 6911 children in the database (0.35%). Fifteen were male (62.5%); 9 (37.5%) had presented antenatally, 6 (25%) neonatally, and 9 (37.5%) postneonatally. Eight (33.3%) were microcephalic, 12 (50%) were dysmorphic, 11 (45.8%) had coexisting epilepsy, and 9 (37.5%) had a cerebral palsy variant. Investigations revealed an etiology in 11 (45.8%): 3 chromosomal abnormality, 3 metabolic disorder, 3 cerebral dysgenesis, and 2 genetic syndromes (Aicardi, Andermann). Outcomes identified included normal or mild developmental delay in 7 (29.2%) and moderate-severe developmental delay in the remaining 17 (70.8%). Factors predictive of successful etiologic determination on bivariate analysis included moderate-severe developmental delay or associated cerebral dysgenesis. Factors predictive of eventual developmental outcome included microcephaly, coexisting epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or cerebral dysgenesis. A spectrum of clinical presentations, underlying etiology, and developmental outcome is thus apparent in children with agenesis of the corpus callosum. An underlying etiology can be identified in slightly less than half of cases, and a normal or mildly delayed outcome is apparent in slightly less than a third. Factors predictive of identifying an underlying etiology or eventual outcome can be identified.",

The disease was proved in four members of this family, in three of them associated with pheochromocytoma. The grandmother (I-1) died at the age of 16 years two months after her first birth. The cause of death was not established. Her daughter (II-1) had 9 births with 5 children alive. Paresthesia and difficulties in walking followed by paraparesis and paraplegia were the first signs of the disease at the age of 58 years. The surgical treatment was performed because of an expansive lesion at the level of Th 3-4. Pathohistological examination was not done. It seems that a haemangioblastoma might be the cause of her disease. Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was documented in a female patient (III-2) in 1972. Two years later she was successfully operated on. Pathohistological examination proved clinical diagnosis. She had also diabetes mellitus, cholelithiasis and cardiomyopathy. She died at the age of 56 years. A right-sided pheochromocytoma was diagnosed in a next female patient (III-4) at the age of 22 years. Her surgical treatment was successful. Retinal haemangioblastomatosis was established 7 years later in this patient. She was blind at the end of her life. Haemangioblastomatosis cerebelli was diagnosed soon, and she died at the age of 51 years. A 12- year old boy (IV-3) presented severe hypertension (36/24 kPa). Left-sided pheochromocytoma was removed in this patient one year later. Right-sided pheochromocytoma was operated on in the same patient at the age of 24 years. An elevated level of urinary dopamine was documented four years after the second operation. A malignant right-sided pheochromocytoma was operated on in the same patient 15 years later. At the same time metastases were found in the lower part of the right lung lobe. A 131-I-MIBG therapy could not be realized. He died at the age of 41. Pathohistological examinations proved the clinical diagnosis in this patient after all of three surgical treatments. MEN 2 syndrome was excluded by proper genetical analyses on the RET-protooncogen. Genetical analyses are in the course to identify the possible mutations of VHL-tumour-suppressor gene through the living members of the family. Multidisciplinary approach is mandatory in diagnosis, follow up and treatment of this specific group of patients. A collaboration among specialists of different fields of medicine (internal medicine, ophthalmology, neurology, radiology, urology, neurosurgery, biochemistry, pathology and genetics) is suggested.",

      "abstractText": "OBJECTIVE: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated progressive encephalopathy (PE) is a common and devastating complication of HIV-1 infection in children, whose risk factors have not yet been clearly defined. Regardless of the age of presentation, PE shortens life expectancy. Paradoxically, as survival of patients has been prolonged as a result of the use of antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of PE has increased. Therefore, a predictive marker of PE emergence is critical. The objective of this study was to determine in an observational study whether any immunologic (CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte counts, monocyte counts) or virologic (viral load [VL], biological characteristics of viral isolates) marker might be predictive of PE and whether any particular marker may be involved in the timing of clinical onset of PE.METHODS: A total of 189 children who were vertically infected with HIV-1 were studied retrospectively, 58 of whom fulfilled criteria of the American Academy of Neurology for PE. T-lymphocyte subsets and monocytes in peripheral blood were quantified by flow cytometry. HIV-1 RNA was measured in plasma using a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Demographic, clinical, and viro-immunologic characteristics in infants were compared with control groups using logistic regression. Proportions were compared using the chi(2) test or Fisher exact test. For each child, immunologic and virologic markers were analyzed in parallel closely before clinical onset of PE and closely after PE onset and compared by using the Student t test for paired samples.RESULTS: Overall, mortality of 58 HIV-1-infected children who developed PE was significantly higher than of children who did not develop this complication. Blood CD8(+) T-lymphocytes <25% in the first months of life suggested a relative risk of progressing to PE 4-fold higher than those with CD8(+) >25% (95% confidence interval: 1.2-13.9) and remained statistically significant after adjustment for treatment. When we compared the PE-positive group with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)/PE-negative group (children who developed clinical category C and without neurologic manifestations) in a cross-sectional study within 12 months before PE or AIDS diagnosis, respectively, the %CD8(+) T-lymphocytes were significantly lower in the PE-positive group. Normalized absolute counts of CD8(+) T-lymphocytes with respect to seroreverting children were significantly lower in the group of children with encephalopathy with respect to the AIDS/PE-negative group (data not shown). It is interesting that a statistically significant increase was observed in circulating monocyte percentages and absolute counts shortly before the first neurologic symptoms compared with values after PE was established and with those from HIV-1-infected controls. With respect to AIDS-related events, PE was strongly associated with anemia and lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis in the PE-positive group with respect to a group of children with AIDS but without PE.CONCLUSION: HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) remains an important clinical concern. The first step toward PE prevention in HIV-1-infected children should be directed at predicting risk of PE and thus the prompt and reliable identification of infants who are at risk for CNS disease progression. Low blood CD8(+) T-lymphocytes is a strong early predictive marker of PE emergence in vertical HIV-1 infection. Indeed, among all of the immunologic and virologic variables assessed in this observational study, the only significant difference during the first months of life are the CD8(+) T-lymphocytes. A peak of significantly higher peripheral monocytes before the onset of PE with respect to established PE has not been previously described, and strengthens the growing evidence that an increased traffic of monocytes to the brain may be a key factor in triggering neurologic symptoms. The suppression of HIV-1 replication is dependent on the presence of a relatively small number of HIV-1-specifof HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, and it is possible that the duration of the neurologically asymptomatic phase for any given child may depend mostly on the magnitude of specific CD8(+) T-lymphocyte responses. Thus, a decrease of CD8(+) T-lymphocytes would diminish the host capacity to control viral infection, as reported in animal models, enabling infected macrophages to cross the blood-brain barrier. Our results advocate the use of CD8(+) T-lymphocyte and monocyte counts to follow-up HIV-1-infected children. We suggest that CD8(+) T-lymphocytes may be the nexus for many different aspects of the disease, namely loss of control of HIV-1 replication determining higher VL, increased traffic of activated and/or infected monocytes, spread of infection to immune sanctuaries, and finally clinical neurologic emergence of PE. Moreover, we suggest that CD8(+) T-lymphocytes or/and monocytes may be used as putative biological markers of neuropathogenicity. This might suggest their use in decision making of when to start more effective antiretroviral regimens for HIV-1 infection of the CNS and the need of new therapies either to preserve or to augment an adequate CD8(+) T-lymphocyte immune response. Early detection of children who are at risk for developing PE is particularly important because aggressive highly active antiretroviral therapy improves neurologic symptoms, allows possible use of neuroprotective treatment to prevent further development of encephalopathy, and emphasizes the relevance of developing therapies aimed to enhance CD8(+) T-lymphocyte function. In conclusion, the surrogate markers routinely used in clinical practice for HIV-1 infection (ie, CD4(+) T-lymphocyte counts and VL) seem to be insufficient to evaluate the clinical involvement of the CNS. Other systemic markers, as the recent proposed markers for PE evolution (cerebrospinal fluid VL by lumbar puncture and brain atrophy by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging) are undoubtedly more invasive than measuring CD8(+) T-lymphocyte and monocyte counts, when the neurologic manifestations of PE are still preventable.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Diagnostic reasoning is a key competence of physicians. We explored the effects of knowledge, practice and additional clinical information on strategy, redundancy and accuracy of diagnosing a peripheral neurological defect in the hand based on sensory examination.METHOD: Using an interactive computer simulation that includes 21 unique cases with seven sensory loss patterns and either concordant, neutral or discordant textual information, 21 3rd year medical students, 21 6th year and 21 senior neurology residents each examined 15 cases over the course of one session. An additional 23 psychology students examined 24 cases over two sessions, 12 cases per session. Subjects also took a seven-item MCQ exam of seven classical patterns presented visually.RESULTS: Knowledge of sensory patterns and diagnostic accuracy are highly correlated within groups (R2 = 0.64). The total amount of information gathered for incorrect diagnoses is no lower than that for correct diagnoses. Residents require significantly fewer tests than either psychology or 6th year students, who in turn require fewer than the 3rd year students (p < 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of subjects is affected both by level of training (p < 0.001) and concordance of clinical information (p < 0.001). For discordant cases, refutation testing occurs significantly in 6th year students (p < 0.001) and residents (p < 0.01), but not in psychology or 3rd year students. Conversely, there is a stable 55% excess of confirmatory testing, independent of training or concordance.CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge and practice are both important for diagnostic success. For complex diagnostic situations reasoning components employing redundancy seem more essential than those using strategy.",

      "abstractText": "The cerebellar examination evolved from observations of experimental lesions made by neurophysiologists and clinical descriptions of patients with trauma to the cerebellum. At the beginning of the 19th century, neurophysiologists such as Luigi Rolando, Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens, and John Call Dalton, Jr. ablated portions of the cerebellum of a variety of animals and observed staggering gait, clumsiness, and falling from side to side without loss of strength. They concluded that the cerebellum coordinated voluntary movements. In 1899, Joseph Francois F?lix Babinski observed that patients with cerebellar lesions could not execute complex movements without breaking down into their elemental movements and described the defect as dysmetria. In 1902, Babinski coined the term dysdiodochokinesis to describe the inability to perform rapid execution of movements requiring alternate contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles. Gordon Holmes in 1904 described the phenomena of rebound, noting that if a limb ipsilateral to a cerebellar lesion is suddenly released from tension, the appendage will flail. In 1917, Gordon Holmes reported hypotonia and dysmetria in men wounded by gunshot wounds to their cerebellum. These observations were rapidly included in descriptions of the cerebellar examination in popular contemporaneous textbooks of neurology. Modern observations have demonstrated that the cerebellum influences such cognitive functions such as planning, verbal fluency, abstract reasoning, prosody, and use of correct grammar.",

Repeated studies were performed in 44 patients after a mean +/- SD interval of 34 +/- 9 months.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Levels of N-acetylaspartate as measured by (1)H-MRS.RESULTS: Patients with MS and an epsilon4 allele (n = 19) had a significantly lower mean +/- SD N-acetylaspartate-creatine ratio than those without an epsilon4 allele (n = 53) (1.73 +/- 0.26 vs 1.89 +/- 0.24; P =.04) despite the absence of significant differences in age at onset, disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and number of previous relapses between subgroups. During follow-up, the drop in the N-acetylaspartate-creatine ratio of epsilon4 carriers was also significantly larger (-0.31 vs -0.10; P =.01). This was paralleled by a higher number of relapses (mean +/- SD, 4.1 +/- 2.7 vs 1.7 +/- 1.6; P =.02) and a faster although nonsignificant progression of disability (mean +/- SD (Delta)Expanded Disability Status Scale score, 0.9 +/- 1.8 vs 0.3 +/- 1.1; P =.19).CONCLUSIONS: The APOE epsilon4 allele has a negative effect on the course of MS, and increasing axonal damage may be an important mechanism.",

We performed a retrospective analysis from our neurooncological database concerning the occurrence of seizures in patients with primary brain tumors, patients with cerebral metastases and in cancer patients without brain tumors. Patients with low grade gliomas, such as astrocytoma WHO I + II (69%), oligodendroglioma WHO II (50%), and mixed glioma WHO II-III (56%) were more likely to have seizures than patients with anaplastic glioma WHO III (44%), glioblastoma WHO IV (48%) or meningeoma (45%). In patients with brain metastasis, melanoma (67%), cancer of the lung (29%), and gastrointestinal tumors (21%) were the primaries with the highest frequency of seizures. In cancer patients without brain metastases or primary brain tumors, seizures occurred in 4%. In conclusion, the occurrence of epileptic seizures in patients suffering from primary brain tumors, as well as in patients with cerebral metastases, varied within the tumor entity. Therefore, especially in brain tumors where a higher probability of epileptic seizures is expected, they should be taken into account in the care of cancer patients.",

In animal experiments, 1-BP inhalation (1500 ppm) caused hyperexcitability in the CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) [Journal of Occupational Health 42 (2000) 149, Journal of Occupational Health 44 (2002) 156]. We studied whether the hyperexcitability is associated with changes of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and protein kinase C (PKC). Male Wistar rats were exposed to 1-BP for 6 hours in a day in an exposure chamber with a concentration of 700 ppm for 8 weeks. After the inhalation, paired-pulse ratios of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spikes (PSs) were analyzed in the CA1 and DG of hippocampal slices. Control rats were then given fresh air in the inhalation chamber. Semiquantitative immunoblotting analyses of protein kinases using antibodies against active and conventional protein kinases were done using the whole hippocampus. A paired-pulse ratio of PS was increased at the 5 ms interpulse interval in the CA1 and at the 10-20 ms interpulse intervals in the DG. The amount of active MAPK and total amount of CaMKIIalpha and beta were significantly increased by 28, 29, and 46% compared to control, respectively, without any change in PKC activity. In contrast, the amount of active CaMKIIbeta was decreased to 78%. These results suggest that modifications of intracellular signaling cascades are associated with hyperexcitability that occurred in the hippocampal formation of rats exposed to the chronic inhalation of 1-BP.",

To better elucidate the phenotype of these atypical patients (18)FDG/(18)F-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) were performed in a subgroup to look for cortical and striatal metabolic changes suggestive of multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), or dementia with Lewy bodies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rating of cerebral vascular lesion load, putaminal atrophy, and neuropsychological testing were also performed. Discriminant function analysis of (18)F-dopa/(18)FDG striatal metabolism in 43 patients failed to separate atypical ethnic minority from typical Caucasian Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Additionally, atypical Indian and African-Caribbean patients did not show cortical reductions in glucose metabolism suggestive of PSP, CBD, or DLB. Cerebral vascular lesion load rated in these patients did not differ between atypical and typical PD groups, and none of the atypical patients had MRI changes suggestive of MSA or PSP. Our results suggest the atypical parkinsonian phenotype seen in African-Caribbean and Indian patients represents a levodopa-refractory form of PD separate from MSA or PSP in most patients.",

Ten Cerro de Pasco (CP) natives living at 4,338 meters were biopsied. Three of these subjects had no burning feet/burning hands (BF/BH); three had BF/BH; and four had chronic mountain sickness (CMS), a maladaptation syndrome resulting from living in the Andes, all with BF/BH. Three patients with CMS were biopsied in Lima within hours after leaving CP. Two normal Lima natives were biopsied in Lima. Symptom scores for BF/BH and CMS score ratings were used. The nerves were assayed for Na+, K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), cytochrome oxidase (CO), substance P (SP), and endothelin (ET).RESULTS: Low ATPase was inversely related to symptom scores and CMS scores (p < 0.001). Patients with CMS biopsied in normoxia (Lima) had ATPase levels similar to those of controls. Nerve motor conduction velocities and sensory action potentials were normal. CO was inversely related to age (p < 0.03) and no relation of SP to any variable was found. ET levels were lower in sea level natives (p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Acral paresthesias are associated with low ATPase in peripheral nerves. Lower ET levels of sea level natives likely reflect lowered release from vasa nervorum.",

The annual incidence of first visits was 10.6 per 1,000 people. 60% of the patients were women. The average age was 51.6 years old. Headache was the most frequent reason for the visiting the doctor. One out of every three patients visited because of headache and/or facial pain. The five most frequent diagnoses in the under 65 group were, in descending order of frequency: migraine, tension type headache, epilepsy, syncope and anxiety. The five most common diagnoses in the over 65 group were, in descending order of frequency: Alzheimer, Parkinson, transitory cerebral ischemia, cerebral thrombosis and epilepsy.CONCLUSIONS: The type of ambulatory neurological pathology depends on the age of the patients, and thus we find that headache is prevalent in the younger patients whereas neurodegenerative and vascular pathological conditions are more common in those over the age of 65.",

An Ad Hoc Committee from the Neurology History Study Group of the SEN has researched the medical hagiography with any kind of neurological relationship (neurohagiography), in order to make a hagiography study of every saint related to our speciality, with the added luck of proposing a patron for Neurology with hispanic origin. In this pioneer study of historiographic research different documents related with the medical hagiography have been studied, especially the Index ac Status Causarum, and information coming from different national ecclesiastic archives. A total of 342 saints share the patronage of 137 diseases, of which a 27,7% are related in some way to Neurology. Headache constitutes the prime cause of the invocations, with 20 saints. Another 11 saints plead for epilepsy; to these we also must add another six for so called possessed patients. Therefore, two of the three main causes of invocation (headache, fever and epilepsy) come up to chronic processes. Of all the saints with a hispanic origin candidates to the patronage of the neurologists San Lamberto Caesaraugustanus stands out, who died in the year 303 during Diocletian persecution. Belonging to the selected standing of \"cephalophoric martyrs\" (those beheahed who carry their own head in their hands), he was able to walk an important distance (about six kilometres) with his head split from the body, a fact only understood as a suprahuman phenomenon thanks to which he has becomes the brain transplant pioneer.",

The purpose of our ongoing study of the subject was to define new disease entities among them by using primarily MR imaging pattern recognition.METHODS: We identified seven unrelated patients with a distinct MR imaging pattern consisting of hypomyelination and atrophy of the basal ganglia (neostriatum) and cerebellum (H-ABC). We reviewed the clinical, MR imaging, MR spectroscopic, and laboratory data.RESULTS: Clinically, the patients' diseases were characterized by variably disturbed early development followed by increasing extrapyramidal movement abnormalities, ataxia, and spasticity. Mental capacity was variably affected, but it appeared to be relatively preserved. Parents were not related, and none of their siblings were affected. No metabolic defect was found. Follow-up MR imaging demonstrated atrophy of the cerebral white matter, neostriatum, and cerebellum, which was most pronounced in the most clinically severe cases. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic results were normal in the parietal cortex. In the cerebral white matter, myo-inositol and creatine levels were elevated; this finding was compatible with gliosis. N-acetylaspartate and choline levels were normal, suggesting that neither axonal loss nor active demyelination occurred. Proton MR spectroscopic imaging revealed relatively decreased N-acetylaspartate levels in the frontal region.CONCLUSION: The uniform and highly characteristic MR imaging findings, in combination with the similarities in the clinical findings, provide evidence of a distinct nosologic entity. The acronym H-ABC is offered to indicate patients sharing these clinical and MR imaging features.",

Also to study the factors associated with non-compliance and to determine the parents' perceived reasons for non-compliance with appointments.METHODS: It is a prospective study in which 147 epileptic children who attended the neurology clinic during the first 12-months of the study period were included. Patients were recruited into the study after their parents were interviewed using a detailed questionnaire; their compliance with appointments was monitored prospectively over at least a one year from their recruitment into the study. The parents of the other 70 patients who did not attend the clinic were telephoned. Only 32 replied and were asked about the reasons for non-attendance to the clinic.RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of the patients' parents stated that they were complying with the medications while only 53% of them did not miss any appointment to the clinic during the study period. Compliers with appointments were more likely to comply with their medications too. Children with grand-mal epilepsy and absence seizures were found to be more likely to comply with taking medications than patients with febrile, rolandic and myoclonic seizures (P=0.01). Health belief model factors associated with non-compliance were 1. Children encountering side effects from their medications 2. Parents who were not satisfied with the provided services 3. Parents who thought that alternative medicine is more effective than traditional medicine 4. Parents who think that their children are not susceptible. Patients' perceived main reasons for non-compliance were wrongly registered appointments (27.5%), forgetfulness (22.5%) and busy parents.CONCLUSION: Failure to keep the clinic appointment is an indicator of poor compliance with medications. A telephone call is recommended to reduce the role of clinic non-compliance. Developing a questionnaire form to investigate parents health belief model could be used routinely by social workers and then health education could be tailored for each patient and parent.",

We assessed whether a case-based palliative medicine curriculum could improve medical house staff opioid prescribing practices.DESIGN: Prospective chart review of consecutive pharmacy and billing records of patients who received an opioid during hospitalization before and after the implementation of a curricular intervention, consisting of 10 one-hour case-based modules, including 2 pain management seminars.MEASUREMENTS: Consecutive pharmacy and billing records of patients who were cared for by medical residents (n = 733) and a comparison group of neurology and rehabilitative medicine patients (n = 273) that received an opioid during hospitalization in 8-month periods before (1/1/97 to 4/30/97) and after (1/1/99 to 4/30/99) the implementation of the curriculum on the medical service were reviewed. Three outcomes were measured: 1) percent of opioid orders for meperidine; 2) percent of opioid orders with concomminant bowel regimen; and 3) percent of opioid orders using adjuvant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of patients receiving meperidine decreased in the study group, but not in the comparison group. The percentages receiving NSAIDs and bowel medications increased in both groups. In multivariate logistic models controlling for age and race, the odds of an experimental group patient receiving meperidine in the post-period decreased to 0.55 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.32 to 0.96), while the odds of receiving a bowel medication or NSAID increased to 1.48 (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.03) and 1.53 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.32), respectively. In the comparison group models, the odds of receiving a NSAID in the post-period increased significantly to 2.27 (95% CI, 1.10 to 4.67), but the odds of receiving a bowel medication (0.45; 95% CI, 0.74 to 2.00) or meperidine (0.85; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.30) were not significantly different from baseline.CONCLUSIONS: This palliative care curriculum was associated with a sustained (>6 months) improvement in medical residents' opioid prescribing practices. Further research is needed to understand the changes that occurred and how they can be translated into improved patient outcomes.",

It is used in several industries and is a product of many industrial processes such as oil refining, mining and rayon manufacture. Acute, non fatal H2S intoxication at a concentration of 500 ppm, for few minutes, is followed by brain damage characterised by both immediate and permanent neurobehavioural deficits.OBJECTIVES: The present study describes the neurobehavioral effects of acute, non-fatal H2S intoxication in a healthy 36-year-old male at the workplace.METHODS: Three months after the acute poisoning, the subject was examined via a neurological examination, neuropsychological tests (Mini Mental State, Verbal Span Test, Digit Span Test, Bourdon-Wiersma Dot Cancellation Test, Benton Visual Retention Test, Somatognosia, Simple Visual Reaction Time, Simple Acoustic Reaction Time), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPET).RESULTS: The results showed a reduction of cognitive capabilities, depressive symptoms and personality changes even through the results of neurological examination and neuroimaging techniques were unremarkable.CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological testing is a key issue in neurotoxicology assessment, because conventional neurology has been shown to be insensitive to the chemical neurotoxic effects and neuroimaging techniques are often unclear.",

Only few empirical studies address the possible interaction between facial pain and increased psychosocial stress with a thereby heightened risk for a chronic course of disease.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether FAM or AFP - patients initially presenting with high vs. low pain intensity differ in somatic, psychosocial and socioeconomic parameters.METHOD: We chose to study a population with a primary diagnosis of myofascial pain of the jaw muscles or atypical facial pain and excluded patients with disc displacement, acute arthritis and severe arthrosis. Within nine months, 124 consecutive patients with FAM ( n=108) or AFP ( n=16) were referred to the departments of maxillary surgery, dentistry or neurology of two interdisciplinary academic pain centers. Using the patients'ratings on a 100 mm visual analogue scale concerning their pain intensity, the group was divided in a subgroup initially presenting with low (VAS</=5; n=50) and high pain (VAS>5; n=45). Psychometric evaluation was conducted with the SCL-90R (general psychopathology), the State-Trait-Anger-Expression Inventory (STAXI) and a special questionnaire addressing different aspects of chronic pain (modified SBAS-IV). All patients were assessed by a maxillary surgeon/specialized dentist with the help of a detailed, standardized clinical examination (Helkimo-Index).RESULTS: The group of FAM-/AFP - patients according to our inclusion-/exclusion - criteria presenting with a high pain intensity showed more psychosocial withdrawal ( p=0.013), a worse self-rated psychological status ( p=0.033) and a trend towards more somatization ( p=0.093) than patients with lower pain intensity. There was no correlation between initial pain intensity and somatic parameters of disease as assessed by the standardized clinical examination. Low educational status proved to be the best predictor (p<0.001) for belonging to the high (extensive) pain group.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that FAM-/ AFP - patients initially presenting with a high pain intensity have an increased risk for psychosocial stress and maladaptive coping behaviour. As both variables are empirically validated risk factors for a chronic course in pain-related disease, these patients should be of special interest for an interdisciplianary therapeutic setting including psychotherapeutic approaches.",

Because of the importance of psychosocial factors in the onset and the course of chronic pain syndromes a basic psychosomatic diagnostic in every medical expertise of chronic pain is necessary. In case of hints to relevant psychosocial factors in the onset and the process of chronicity of the pain syndrome a psychotherapeutic medical expertise for the assessment of the form and the severity of the psychic disorder and psychosocial conflicts as causes, consequences or comorbidities of the pain and its social consequences is mandatory. Within a structured procedure using international diagnostic systems and classifications of severity scores and disabilities an reproducible assessment of performance is possible. The guidelines of the German psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic scientific societies for medical expertising are presented with their relevance to the assessement of patients with chronic pain syndromes. Furthermore the authors discuss based on their own experiences and the literature some controversial issues between medical experts and officials in charge of pension insurance companies.",

All patients diagnosed from July 1999 to March 2001 at the Department of Neurology of the Second Xiangya Hospital in China were included. The final diagnosis was based on clinical manifestations, a temporal artery biopsy, response to steroid, and follow-up. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of GCA were tested in the patients identified. Sixteen patients with GCA were identified; 13 (81.25%) patients fulfilled the 1990 ACR criteria for the classification of GCA. Clinical findings included the following: mean age at disease onset 43.13 years (range 28-60) and 81.25% of the patients under the age of 50 when the disease began; men 93.75%; the common initial symptoms including new headache 62.50% and.visual symptoms 18.75%; the common clinical findings at presentation including new headache 93.75%, temporal artery abnormality 81.25%, visual abnormality 56.25%, and fever 25.00%; raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 68.75%; and uncommon findings including jaw claudication, ptosis, fatigue, syncope, hemiparesis; all 16 patients underwent a temporal artery biopsy; inflammatory cell infiltration 68.75% in arterial wall, fragmented internal elastica 100.00%, fibrinoid necrosis 18.75%, smooth muscle cell changes 62.50%, and thrombosis in the lumen 31.25%. The mean time from symptom onset to suspicion of GCA or biopsy was 5.52 months (range 0.25-24.33); the initial diagnosis was wrong in 87.50% of patients. These examples are too small a number to permit definite conclusion. But the results suggest that GCA may not be a rare disorder in China, mean age at disease onset was relatively young, males may be more susceptible, the clinical features of GCA have not been widely appreciated yet, there was a delay between diagnosis and treatment, and initial diagnosis was wrong in many patients.",

Six patients (four women and two men) had attacks of migraine aura without headache. Among the remaining 26 patients (18 women and eight men), the duration of the headache phase was <24 h in 23 (88.5%); pain location was bilateral in 14 (53.8%) and unilateral in 12, but occurring on the opposite side to aura only in one patient; pain intensity was mild or moderate in 13 (50.0%).

Things were quite different during the period +/- 1850 - +/- 1950, when 'chorea minor' was the subject of hundreds of publications. In those days, the practising neurologist stood a good chance of coming across patients with such a degree of muscular hypotonia (a characteristic feature of severe Sydenham's) that he was inclined to infer the presence of paralysis. Those instances used to be denoted as chorea mollis or chorea paralytica. According to textbooks then considered to be authoritative, any doubt regarding the diagnosis of Sydenham's chorea was largely removed if one succeeded in eliciting Gordon-Hey's reflex. This eponym turns out to be as fascinating as the question of its still largely unclarified pathophysiology. In spite of that, mention of the reflex has wholly disappeared from the textbooks of neurology since circa forty years.",

The guideline for the treatment of back pain released by the German Medical Association was examined as well as the one released by the German Association for physical therapy and rehabilitation, the guideline on cervical and lumbal nerve root compression syndrome of the German Association of Neurosurgeons, the guideline for cancer pain of the Drug Committee of the German Medical Association was compared with the one of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Pain Treatment. The guideline for the treatment of chronic headache and facial pain of the Medical Association was evaluated and the guideline for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia of the German Association of Neurosurgery and Neurology, also the guideline for the treatment of acute postoperative and posttraumatic pain. All guidelines show deficiencies in different aspects and of different severity. At first there are deficiencies in interdisciplinary formulation of the guidelines and identification and interpretation of evidence of multimodal pain treatment options. The most prominent deficiency is the lack of implementation and application trials or impulses by all author associations. This way all expenditure on releasing guidelines is given away without improving quality of pain treatment. The authors' recommendation is to adjust to guidelines and, if they are working or not, tell the authors and improve interdisciplinary in pain treatment guidelines.",

In addition, disease-causing mutations in the tau gene on chromosome 17 have been detected in some families with autosomal dominant FTD and parkinsonism. In FTD, the pathological accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau suggests that the tau gene may be a genetic risk factor for this disorder.OBJECTIVE: To confirm or refute the association between the H1 haplotype or the H1H1 genotype of the tau gene and FTD.DESIGN: Case-control study.SETTING: Neurology departments of 12 French university hospitals.PARTICIPANTS: One hundred unrelated patients with FTD and 79 controls.METHODS: Tau genotype (contiguous polymorphisms in exons 1, 7, and 13 and in intron 9 used to reconstruct the extended haplotypes H1 and H2). Clinical examination, psychometric testing, laboratory tests, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, and electroencephalography for patients with FTD.RESULTS: The H1H1 genotype was significantly overrepresented in patients with FTD compared with controls (62% vs 46%; P=.01, 1-sided; odds ratio adjusted for age and sex, 1.95). After stratification according to apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, we found a significant interaction between APOE and tau genotypes (P=.03).CONCLUSIONS: This study of the largest series of patients with FTD confirms the primary role of tau in FTD and establishes that the H1 haplotype of the tau gene and the E2 allele of APOE interact by an unknown mechanism that increases the risk of FTD.",

A number of studies on utility measurements were conducted and published in the past. We retrieved 164 English-language articles which appeared in 1966 through 1999 for a systematic review. The number of reports has been increasing at an accelerating pace, especially during the past decade. The most widely used method of utility measurement was time trade-off, TTO (40%), followed by rating scale, RS (31%) and standard gamble, SG (29%). The utility of chronic health status was more frequently reported as compared with acute health status (907 vs 86). Accordingly, frequently explored clinical categories were cardiology, neurology, nephrology, and gastroenterology. Specifically, coronary heart disease (52 utilities), physical disability due to neurological diseases (45 utilities), chronic renal failure (74 utilities), and colorectal cancer (29 utilities) were subject to utility measurement. Mental or social dysfunctioning accounted for only a small proportion (48 utilities). There is a strong tendency for RS to yield the lowest and SG to yield the highest values. We compiled an extensive list of the results of studies on utility as a reference for health care professionals in this field.",

A retrospective hospital and neurology clinic chart review was done of all 14 children commenced on the classic ketogenic diet at full calories without a prior fast between January 1, 1997, and May 31, 2001, to determine time to ketosis, time to good ketosis (urine ketones > or =80 mg/dL), and success of the ketogenic diet. Median age at diet initiation was 63 months (25th-75th percentile 47-149 months). There were 7 girls and 7 boys. Four had symptomatic generalized epilepsy, whereas the remainder had partial seizures +/- secondary generalization. Twelve of 14 children suffered seizures on a daily basis prior to the ketogenic diet. Six were commenced on the diet as outpatients, whereas 8 were admitted to hospital. No patients were fasted. All admitted patients were started on a 1:1 ketogenic ratio at full calories for the first 24 hours and advanced to a 3:1 or 4:1 ratio over 3 to 4 days, while outpatients were started on a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio and similarly advanced. Thirteen of 14 patients were successfully started on the diet, with 1 developing vomiting and food refusal during the initial hospitalization but after ketosis was established. One child was lost to follow-up after initial hospital discharge. Information regarding time to ketosis was determined for all inpatients. Mean time to onset of ketosis was 33 hours (range 17 to 48) and to good ketosis, 58 hours (range 40 to 84). Five of 12 children (42%) experienced success with the ketogenic diet, and all of these had their antiepileptic medications either withdrawn (n = 3) or decreased (n = 2). The ketogenic diet can be effectively initiated without a fast in children with epilepsy. Time to ketosis and diet efficacy are similar to protocols that use a fast.",

      "abstractText": "The First Teaching Clinic in Clinical Pharmacology, sponsored by the American College of Clinical Pharmacology in September 1992, was designed for the preparation and development of new clinical pharmacology problem-solving (CPPS) units. CPPS units are case histories that illustrate pertinent principles in clinical pharmacology. Each unit consists of the following sections: introduction, learning objectives, pretest, four clinical pharmacology scenarios, posttest, answers to pre- and posttest questions, and selected references. The clinical pharmacology content of the CPPS units place greater emphasis on clinical information, drug selection, and risk/benefit analyses, and thus they complement the basic pharmacology presented in the patient-oriented problem-solving (POPS) units. In general, the CPPS units are intended for use by students more advanced in clinical pharmacology than first- and second-year medical students. The CPPS unit \"Clinical Pharmacology of Antiepileptic Drug Use: Clinical Pearls about the Perils of Patty\" was developed for use by third- and fourth-year medical students doing rotations in neurology or clinical pharmacology; advanced pharmacy students; residents in neurology, pediatrics, internal medicine, and family practice; fellows in clinical pharmacology, and those taking the board examination in clinical pharmacology. The CPPS unit titled \"Geriatric Clinical Psychopharmacology\" was written for third- and fourth-year medical students; residents in psychiatry, family practice, and internal medicine;fellows in clinical pharmacology; and those studying for boards in clinical pharmacology. The CPPS unit \"Anisocoria and Glaucoma\" was written for more advanced students of clinical pharmacology. The CPPS unit titled \"Antiepileptic Drugs\" was intended for second-year medical students. The second teaching clinic was held in November 1993 and focused on the development and editing of the CPPS units and their evaluations by faculty and students from academic centers. Evaluations by faculty and students have been overwhelmingly positive. Requests to use the CPPS units in various clinical pharmacology teaching programs were received from numerous schools within the United States and from abroad. The third teaching clinic in September 1995 included a follow-up focused on the uses of drug information databases in case problem exercises. These examples are presented to demonstrate the variety of educational activities the American College of Clinical Pharmacology is sponsoring to fulfill its strategic initiative dedicated to offer innovative teaching programs and to develop new teaching materials in clinical pharmacology. Collectively, all of the teaching clinics, symposia, and workshop efforts, sponsored by the various academic professional societies alone or together over the past decade, are necessary if new and innovative teaching materials in the field of basic science and in the fields of pharmacology and clinical pharmacology are to be continuously developed to keep pace with the new, rapidly changing developments in medicine to provide the best treatment for patients in the 21st century.",

Granulocytopenia was ascertained in seven, whereas agranulocytosis was diagnosed in two patients of this population. The latter two comprised a 42-year-old female with schizoaffective psychosis and a 35-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia. The female patient received clozapine in a daily dose of 400 mg, which induced agranulocytosis after 2 months. The male patient was treated with 225-mg/day clozapine and the time to the diagnosis of agranulocytosis was 6 weeks. These adverse reactions were recognized early and the appropriate treatment of agranulocytosis resulted in complete recovery in both cases.",

There were 81 patients (61 women, 20 men) with an average age of 36.6 years (range, 8-71 yr); all except four patients were evaluated between 1995 and 1999. Follow-up was obtained from chart review. Mean follow-up time was 54.5 weeks, with a range of 4 to 456 weeks.INTERVENTION: One or more treatment methods, including dietary manipulation, medication (tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers), and neurology consultation, were applied sequentially as necessary.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Response to therapy was defined as greater than 75% reduction in symptom recurrence rate.RESULTS: Overall, 72% of patients experienced resolution or dramatic reduction of their attacks of vertigo or disequilibrium. Of the 13 patients treated with the introduction of dietary manipulation alone, 100% received significant relief. Of the 31 patients treated with dietary manipulation and the addition of a medication, 77% of these patients had significant relief. Of the final group of 37 patients treated with another medication or a neurology consultation, 57% received substantial relief. Of the responders, the majority (>95%) experienced an equal reduction in both vertigo or disequilibrium and headache symptoms. Interestingly, 100% of the patients in the migraine without active headache group received substantial relief of their vertigo or disequilibrium symptoms with migraine therapy.CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is effective therapy for the common problem of migraine-associated dizziness.",

We determined demographic characteristics, clinical features, neuroimaging data, and outcome of acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage occurring in people aged 85 and older.DESIGN: Prospective collection of data from a hospital-based registry.SETTING: Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona (an acute care, 350-bed teaching hospital serving a population of approximately 250,000).PARTICIPANTS: Between January 1986 and December 1995, data were collected on 2,000 stroke patients admitted consecutively to the department of neurology (25 beds and an acute stroke unit).MEASUREMENTS: For the purpose of this study, all cases of intracerebral hemorrhage were selected (n = 229). Demographic data, clinical features, neuroimaging findings, and outcome variables (in-hospital mortality and medical complications developed during hospitalization)in patients aged 85 and older (n = 28) were compared with patients who were younger than age 85 (n = 201). Distinctive clinical features of intracerebral hemorrhage in very old people were assessed by multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Intracerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed in 11% of subjects aged 85 and older included in the stroke registry and accounted for 12% of all cases of intracerebral hemorrhage. Very old people with intracerebral hemorrhage showed a significantly higher frequency of female gender (75% vs 32%, P < .005), altered consciousness (64% vs 43%, P < .05), multiple topographic involvement (29% vs 13%, P < .03), undetermined etiology of bleeding (50% vs 27%, P < .02), moderate or severe neurological deficit at hospital discharge (89% vs 58%, P < .005), and in-hospital mortality (50% vs 27%, P < .01) than younger people. After multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio (OR) = 3.2,95% confidence interval (CI) - 1.27-7.99) and moderate or severe neurological deficit at hospital discharge (OR =4.75, 95% Cl = 1.36-16.55) were independent clinical factors associated with intracerebral hemorrhage in very old people.CONCLUSIONS: Patients aged 85 and older with intra-cerebral hemorrhage showed some peculiar clinical features and poorer outcome, including higher in-hospital mortality and moderate or severe neurological deficit at hospital discharge, than younger patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.",

All patients underwent a structured history and neurologic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was used as the gold standard for determining the presence of intracranial metastases. The association between baseline patient characteristics, history variables, and variables from the neurologic examination in patients with intracranial metastases was evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses in combination with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.RESULTS: Sixty-eight consecutive patients were included in the current study (48 females and 20 males). The mean age of the patients was 57 years (range, 24-88 years; standard deviation +/- 13.3 years). Breast carcinoma was the primary tumor in 32 patients (47.1%) and lung carcinoma was the primary tumor in 12 patients (17.6%). Intracranial metastases occurred in 22 patients (32.4%). The occurrence of intracranial metastases was predicted in the multivariate logistic regression analyses by one baseline patient characteristic variable and 2 history variables (i.e., headache duration of < or =10 weeks [odds ratio (OR) of 11.0; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.1-108.2], emesis [OR of 4.0; 95% CI, 1.1-14.3], and pain not of tension- type [OR of 6.7; 95% CI, 1.8-25.1]). No variable from the neurologic examination was found to add information to the prediction model. When at least one of the three predictors was present, all patients with intracranial metastases could be identified with this prediction model. MRI could be omitted in 12 patients (26%) without intracranial metastases. The ROC area under curve of this model was 0.83.CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial metastases were found in 32.4% of the cancer patients with headache as the presenting symptom. Although 3 significant clinical predictors were found (headache duration < or =10 weeks, emesis, and pain not of tension- type), few patients could be excluded from undergoing MRI because of a low specificity. Therefore, MRI of the brain was considered to be warranted in all patients in the current study.",

Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) has been reported to detect early ischemic damage (cytotoxic edema) as bright areas of high signal intensity and vasogenic edema as areas of heterogeneous signal intensity. We report various DWI findings in 2 patients with hyperglycemic HCHB.OBJECTIVES: To describe the DWI and gradient echo findings and characterize the types of edema in HCHB associated with hyperglycemia.SETTING: A tertiary referral center neurology department.DESIGN AND METHODS: Two patients with HCHB associated with hyperglycemia underwent DWI, gradient echo imaging, and conventional MR imaging with gadolinium enhancement. The patients had an elevated serum glucose level on admission and a long history of uncontrolled diabetes, and the symptoms were controlled by dopamine receptor blocking agents. Initial DWIs were obtained 5 to 20 days after symptom onset. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in the abnormal lesions with visual inspection of DWI and T2-weighted echo planar images.RESULTS: T1- and T2-weighted MR images and brain computed tomographic scans showed high signal intensities in the right head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen. Gradient echo images were normal. The DWIs showed bright high signal intensity in the corresponding lesions (patient 1), and the ADC values were decreased. The decrease in ADC and the high signal intensity on DWI persisted despite the disappearance of HCHB, even after 70 days.CONCLUSIONS: Gradient echo MR imaging findings were normal in HCHB with hyperglycemia, whereas DWI and the ADC map showed restricted diffusion, which suggests that hyperviscosity, not petechial hemorrhage, with cytotoxic edema can cause the observed MR abnormalities.",

Four years later, she developed difficulty in dressing and behavioral problems such as eating rice with her hands, going out of her house without purposes, and difficulty in finding the rest room in her house. She was admitted to the neurology service of Hatsuishi Hospital on January 19, 1996, when she was 64 years of the age. On admission, she was alert but markedly demented. The score of Hansegawa Dementia Scale was 0/30. She was unable to make any coherent conversation. She appeared to have dressing apraxia but did not appear to have aphasia. Cranial nerves were intact. She walked in small steps with stooped posture. She did not have motor weakness but she showed plastic rigidity in all four limbs. No tremor or ataxia was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were within normal limits but the plantar response was extensor bilaterally. She continued to deteriorate after admission. In May of 1998, she started to fall. In June of 1998, she had a generalized convulsion. In January of 1999, she became unable to take foods orally and a gastrostomy was placed. She expired on May 29, 1990. She was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had Alzheimer's disease. The question was whether her parkinsonism was a part of her Alzheimer's disease or she had an additional disease to explain her parkinsonism. Post-mortem examination revealed moderate to marked atrophy of the frontal and the temporal lobes as well as in the limbic areas with dilatation of the lateral ventricles. Marked neuronal loss was noted in the CA 1 to the subiculum region with gliosis. Neurofibrillary tangles were seen in the remaining neurons. Neuropil threads were seen by Gallyas-Braak staining. Similar changes were seen in the parahippocampal gyrus and in the entorhinal cortex. Senile plaques were seen in the insular cortex and in other cortical areas. Cortical type Lewy bodies were seen in the cingulate cortex. The Meynert nucleus showed marked neuronal loss and gliosis. The substantia nigra and the locus coeruleus showed moderate loss of pigmented neurons. Lewy bodies were seen in these regions. The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve was retained, however, one Lewy body was observed. Pathologic diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease plus Parkinson's disease. It is an interesting question whether or not her parkinsonism was due to nigral lesion or frontal lesions. It is known that parkinsonism may complicate in advanced Alzheimer's disease not necessarily due to nigral lesion. On the other hand, in incidental Lewy body disease, the substantia nigra shows mild Parkinson's disease-like change without clinical parkinsonism. This patient appeared to have been a true complication of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",

The study was designed to determine whether there is difference between the serum and CSF lactic acid concentrations in children with progressive encephalopathies (PE), static (non-progressive) encephalopathies (NPE) and non progressive encephalopathies with concomitant epilepsy (NPEE), and whether the clinical status correlates with the concentration of these biochemical markers in children with PE.MATERIAL/METHODS: The assessment involved 138 children of both sexes, whose age ranged between 8 months and 15 years, diagnosed and treated in the Neurology Department at the Pediatric Clinic of the Silesian Medical Academy in Katowice between 1995 and 1997. Lactate concentrations were determined in serum and cerebro-spinal fluid and analyzed statistically.RESULTS: The findings showed higher serum and CSF concentrations in children with PE than in patients who manifested non-progressive forms of encephalopathy. The degree of clinical symptom aggravation in PE children was likewise analyzed and compared to the values of lactate concentrations in body fluids; however, no correlation was found between these parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Children with progressive encephalopathies present higher lactate concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid than patients with static (non-progressive) encephalopathy.",

The patients had new-onset disease before age 14 years between 1995 and 1999. They underwent clinical, EEG, and magnetic resonance imaging investigations.RESULTS: The patients could be divided in three main groups according to likely etiology, as suggested by Harvey et al. (Neurology 1997;49:960-8). Group 1 consisted of eight (26.7%) children with malformations or long-standing, nonprogressive tumors (developmental TLE). Arachnoid cysts were found in three, dual pathology [cortical dysplasia and hippocampal sclerosis (HS)] in one, and focal cortical dysplasia with glioproliferative changes in one patient. Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor was responsible for the epilepsy in one, and ganglioglioma, in two children. Group 2 consisted of seven (23.3%) children with a significant antecedent and/or HS. Five children had a significant illness or event before the onset of TLE, including perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in one, encephalitis in one, traumatic brain injury in two, and complex febrile seizures in one. HS was found in the patients with traumatic brain injury and complex febrile seizures in the history in addition to two children without known antecedents. Group 3 comprised 15 (50%) children with no abnormality on neuroimaging and no significant antecedents (cryptogenic TLE).CONCLUSIONS: Etiologic differences between children with new-onset TLE may have prognostic implications: children with TLE and significant antecedents/HS are expected to have the greatest risk of continued seizures and psychological problems.",

The purpose of this study was to assess \"ictal\" regional cerebral blood flow with Tc-99m ethylcysteinate dimer (ECD) SPECT in patients having acute hallucinations, and to compare the findings to the \"interictal\" state.METHODS: A prospective study was performed to evaluate patients admitted to the neurology department with nonpsychiatric and nonepileptic visual hallucinations. The nine patients included in the study underwent thorough neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. A computed tomographic (CT) scan was performed when each patient was admitted, and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made during their hallucinations. All patients underwent a brain SPECT while having acute hallucinations (ictal SPECT), and a follow-up scan was obtained 2 to 3 weeks later.RESULTS: All patients had normal ictal EEG findings during the hallucinations. Seven of nine patients had increased perfusion on the SPECT studies in one or more regions, with a mean lesion-to-contralateral ratio of 2.1 (range, 1.5 to 2.7). Three of the seven patients had findings consistent with a cerebrovascular accident. After treatment, the hallucinations disappeared in two patients and the motor deficit improved dramatically. The follow-up SPECT study showed significant improvement in all patients 1 week later. Charles Bonnet syndrome, frontal lobe dementia, and Anton syndrome were diagnosed in three other patients, and the last one had no identifiable background disease, all with normal findings of EEG, CT, and magnetic resonance examinations. They all responded readily to carbamazepine therapy, and the follow-up SPECT study showed resolution of the findings. Two of nine patients showed posterior cortical hypoperfusion, and eventually Lewy body disease was diagnosed. The SPECT showed no evidence of regional hyperperfusion.CONCLUSIONS: This prospective preliminary study suggests that brain imaging using SPECT may be useful in identifying the mechanisms and evolution of blood flow abnormalities in certain subgroups of patients who have visual hallucinations and may assist in the selection of specific therapy.",

Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their functional capabilities: group A (independent: stages I-II of Hoehn and Yahr stages of Parkinson's disease, n = 26); and group B (dependent: Hoehn and Yahr stages 3-5; n = 36).INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sera were analyzed to relate vitamin K concentrations to bone-related biochemical indices. BMD was measured by computed radiograph densitometry.RESULTS: Group B had significantly lower metacarpal BMD (P <.0001) lower serum concentrations of vitamin K1 (P <.01) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD; P <.0001) than group A. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels were higher in group B than in group A (P <.0001). The serum concentration of vitamin K1 correlated positively with that of 25-OHD (r =.735, P <.0001), and negatively with undercarboxylated osteocalcin (r = -.751, P <.0001) and Hoehn and Yahr stages (r =.787, P <.0001). Multiple regression analysis identified Hoehn and Yahr stages, vitamin K1, 25-OHD, and undercarboxylated osteocalcin as independent determinants of BMD (P <.0364.0003).CONCLUSION: In functionally dependent women with PD, nutritional vitamin K1 deficiency is believed to reduce production of fully carboxylated osteocalcin, causing reduced BMD.",

Since then, a number of new compounds including non-ergot dopamine agonists (DA) and sustained-release levodopa have been released and studied. Thus, the issue of treatment in de novo PD patients warrants reexamination. Specific questions include: 1) does selegiline offer neuroprotection; 2) what is the best agent with which to initiate symptomatic treatment in de novo PD; and 3) is there a benefit of sustained release levodopa over immediate-release levodopa? Using evidence-based principles, a literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify all human trials in de novo PD between 1966 and 1999. Only articles that fulfilled class I or class II evidence were included. Based on this review, the authors conclude: 1) Selegiline has very mild symptomatic benefit (level A, class II evidence) with no evidence for neuroprotective benefit (level U, class II evidence). 2) For PD patients requiring initiation of symptomatic therapy, either levodopa or a DA can be used (level A, class I and class II evidence). Levodopa provides superior motor benefit but is associated with a higher risk of dyskinesia. 3) No evidence was found that initiating treatment with sustained-release levodopa provides an advantage over immediate-release levodopa (level B, class II evidence).",

Seizure types included generalized tonic-clonic in 80.7% of patients, complex partial in 28.3%, simple partial in 14.4%, atypical absence in 2.6% and myoclonic in 1.4%, and 30.4% of patients had more than one seizure type. EEG, CT brain, MRI brain and neuropsychological evaluation were obtained in 81.2%, 61.7%, 17.0% and 2.2% of patients, respectively. The etiology of epilepsy was cryptogenic in 59.9%, symptomatic in 35.1% and idiopathic in 3.9%; the commonest were intracranial infection, cerebral vascular disease, cranial trauma and perinatal insult. Phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate were the most frequently used drugs and 25.9% of patients were taking more than two drugs. 48.3% of patients had active seizures in the past six months and 26.4% were considered to have unsatisfactory control of their epilepsy. Medical refractoriness of epilepsy was associated with a history of perinatal insult, intracranial infection, congenital brain malformation, intracranial neoplasm, cerebral vascular disease, hippocampal sclerosis, mental retardation and a history of status epilepticus (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: In this local cohort of adult patients with epilepsy under specialist care, there were a considerable number of patients falling into the category of cryptogenic epilepsy. Risk factors associated with medical refractoriness are similar to previous studies.",

The frequency of camptodactyly in patients referred to three general neurology outpatient clinics, two in district general hospitals and one in a regional neuroscience centre, over the course of one year (2000) was measured. Five out of 978 consecutive new outpatients (0.5%) had camptodactyly (2 M, 3 F); four had bilateral deformity. In only one was camptodactyly the reason for referral. In two cases, camptodactyly was entirely incidental to the neurological symptoms; in two others it was incidental but might have been confused with the neurological features. In three cases other family members were affected, in a manner consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. Camptodactyly is not infrequently observed in the general neurology outpatient clinic. It merits attention in order to avoid confusion with other, neurogenic, causes of clawing, and so avoid unnecessary investigation.",

He was well until 1985, when he was 49 years old, when he noted rest tremor in his right hand. Soon tremor appeared in his left hand as well. He was seen in our clinic and levodopa was prescribed. He was doing well with this medication, however, in 1993, he started to suffer from on-off phenomenon. He also noted visual hallucination. In 1994, he stole a watermelon and ate it in the shop. He repeated such abnormal behaviours. In 1995, he was admitted to the neurology service of Hatsuishi Hospital. On admission, he was alert and oriented. He did not seem to be demented; however, he admitted stealing and hypersexual behaviours. No aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia was noted. In the cranial nerves, downward gaze was markedly restricted. He showed masked and seborrhoic face, and small voice. No motor palsy was noted, but he walked in small steps with freezing and start hesitation. Marked neck and axial rigidity was noted. Tremor was absent except for in the tongue. No cerebellar ataxia was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished. Plantar response was extensor bilaterally. Forced grasp was noted also bilaterally. He was treated with levodopa and pergolide, but he continued to show on-off phenomenon. His balance problem and akinesia became progressively worse; still he showed hypersexual behaviour problems. He also showed progressive decline in cognitive functions. In 1997, he started to show dysphagia. He developed aspiration pneumonia in July of 1998. In 1999, he developed emotional incontinence and became unable to walk. He also developed repeated aspiration pneumonia. He died on March 1, 2000. He was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at a conclusion that the patient had corticobasal degeneration. Other diagnoses entertained included dementia with Lewy bodies, diffuse Lewy body disease, and frontotemporal dementia. Majority of the participants thought that diffuse Lewy body disease was most likely. Post-mortem examination revealed marked nigral neuronal loss, gliosis and Lewy bodies in the remaining neurons. Abundant Lewy bodies of cortical type were seen wide spread in the cortical areas, but particularly many in the amygdaloid nucleus. Lewy bodies were also seen in the subcortical structures such as the dorsal motor nucleus, oculomotor nucleus, Meynert nucleus, putamen, and thalamus. What was interesting was marked neuronal loss of the pontine nuclei, demyelination of the pontocerebellar fiber, and moderate neuronal loss of the cerebellar Purkinje neurons, a reminiscent of pontocerebellar atrophy. However, the inferior olivary nucleus was intact.",

This was a prospective open trial study with 35 children (16 boys and 19 girls). Not all patients started on the diet at the same time. Each patient was cumulatively enrolled in this study over the period of 4 years. The mean age on diet was 5.37 +/- 3.57 years (2 months-13 years), mean age of onset of seizures was 19.2 +/- 27.47 months (1 days-8 years), and an average duration on ketogenic diet was 7.67 months (6 days to 29 months). The classic \"4:1\" formula ketogenic diet was used with some modification. The patient's parents were allowed to improvise and use any fatty diets available in the market such as coconut milk if needed. Parents were closely supervised and instructed on how to prepare the patient's own meals while in the hospital and continued to attend neurology and nutrition clinics. The seizure outcome and side effects were monitored as well as a daily test for urine ketone.RESULTS: At 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months duration on the diet, 90 per cent seizure reductions were achieved in 62.5 per cent, 68.18 per cent, 75 per cent, and 66.67 per cent of patients remaining on the diet, respectively. The number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used by each patient also decreased as a result of better seizure control.CONCLUSION: Ketogenic diet can be tried as a management option for refractory epilepsy. It is not difficult to implement even in a developing country like Thailand where resources are limited. It may also help reduce the cost of treatment especially in view of the high prices of the new AEDs.",

Only 60% of CIDP patients fulfilled these criteria, which therefore appear poorly sensitive. We therefore sought to revise the electrophysiological criteria. We selected 40 CIDP patients and compared them with 35 patients with axonal polyneuropathy, 116 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) disease, and 66 patients with immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy. The proposed electrophysiological criteria identified 90% of the CIDP patients, although 3% of patients with axonal polyneuropathy were falsely identified. For the CIDP patients, sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 97%, respectively. Of the patients with IgM monoclonal gammaglobulin of undetermined significance (MGUS) and CMT1A, 100% fulfilled these new criteria, whereas 90% and 97%, respectively, fulfilled the AAN criteria. These results suggest that the AAN criteria are more appropriate for IgM MGUS and CMT1A patients than for CIDP patients. We therefore propose new electrophysiological criteria for CIDP that appear to have better sensitivity.",

Although it is an important problem we don t have any statistical information concerning only epilepsy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We took on the task of studying the cases of epilepsy in a Neurology clinic in a third level hospital, from January to August 2000. The clinical records of 127 patients with epilepsy were studied. We excluded patients with febrile seizures and those with only one isolated seizure not related to any neurological injury.RESULTS: There was a slight predominance of men (55.11%) over women (44,8%). A great majority of the patients did not have family history of epilepsy, and the average age of on set was 20.062 years. Idiopathic epilepsy was predominant with a 48,3%, 26,77% were cryptogenic and 25,19% symptomatic. Of this, the most frequent etiology was sclerosis and atrophy of the temporal lobe, followed by cerebrovascular disease. As to image studies 96,06% had CT, MRI or both; and 94,48% had an EEG. Of all the patients a great majority are receiving treatment with one antiepileptic drug (81,88%). Valproic acid and carbamazepine are the most commonly used. 51,98% of patients have not had a seizure in at least 8 months.CONCLUSIONS: It is clear, that our health system provides most of the basic needs required to control most of the epileptic patients. However there are important challenges in the present and pear future, such as developing video encephalography units for brain mapping and supporting new epilepsy surgery programs. It is our mission also to induce public health authorities to realize the impact of Epilepsy in social affairs and economics.",

Among these 41 cases, 35 had complete data and were enrolled for analysis. The male to female ratio was 1:1.19. The mean age of onset was 6.0+/-4.9 months old. Twenty nine percent were classified as cryptogenic and 71% were symptomatic. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was given to 40% of these patients. The initial response rate was 78.6% and the recurrence rate was 36.4%. For those patients not receiving ACTH, vigabatrin and valproic acid were two of the most common choices. At the final visit, 37% patients remained seizure-free, 29% were still suffering from the same seizure, and 34% changed to other seizure types. The final developmental status was normal in 14%, mildly retarded in 20%, and moderate to severely retarded in 66% of the patients.",

Sodium valproate and vigabatrin were the most often used drugs, though other antiepileptic drugs were also used. Nine (24.5%) children achieved good seizure control, out of which five have normal development. Only one child could be weaned off antiepileptic drugs completely.

Clinical and demographic correlates of cognitive impairment and their effects on everyday functioning were determined by multiple linear regression analysis.SETTING: The research clinic of a university department of neurology.PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five inpatients and outpatients with multiple sclerosis and 65 demographically matched healthy controls from the original sample.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean scores of both groups on the neuropsychological test battery in initial and 2 follow-up evaluations (about 4 and 10 years, respectively); number of cognitively impaired subjects, defined by the number of subtests failed; regression coefficients measuring the relationship between clinical variables and cognitive outcome and between mental decline and everyday functioning assessed by the Environmental and the Incapacity Status Scales.RESULTS: Previously detected cognitive defects in verbal memory, abstract reasoning, and linguistic processes were confirmed on the third testing, at which time deficits in attention/short-term spatial memory also emerged. Only 20 of 37 patients who were cognitively unimpaired on initial testing remained so by the end of the follow-up, when the proportion of subjects who were cognitively impaired reached 56%. Degree of physical disability, progressive disease course, and increasing age predicted the extent of cognitive decline. Disability level and degree of cognitive impairment were independent predictors of a patient's handicap in the workplace and in social settings.CONCLUSIONS: In the course of a sufficiently long follow-up, cognitive dysfunction is likely to emerge and progress in a sizable proportion of patients. As multiple sclerosis advances, neurological and cognitive involvement tend to converge. Limitations in a patient's work and social activities are correlated with the extent of cognitive decline, independent of degree of physical disability.",

However, there are few information about the actual care of ALS. We have assessed the management of ALS in Italy in various clinical settings, on basis of a self-reported questionnaire. Thirty-six out of the 80 Italian ALS neurological departments with a particular interest in ALS care answered the questionnaire. The centers were subdivided according the mean number of patients currently followed-up (> or =30 vs. <30). An integrated health-care team for ALS existed in all large centers but only in 14% of small centers (p=0.0001). Diagnosis was communicated to most but not all patients. Symptomatic therapies were generally offered to patients in all centers. Nutritional interventions, including percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), were proposed by most centers, but the percentage of patients who underwent PEG was significantly higher in large centers (p=0.04). Respiratory management seemed to be lacking both in large and in small centers since non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was proposed by only 70% of large and 50% of small centers; however, the percentage of patients who underwent NIPPV was significantly higher in large centers (p=0.03). Moreover, the discussion of respiratory issues was performed quite late in the course of the disease, usually when the patients have first respiratory symptoms. Therefore, there are considerable opportunities to improve the care of ALS patients in Italy, primarily through the education of neurologists on AAN standards of care for ALS.",

The prognosis for patients is related to the relevance of the initial diagnostic and therapeutic measures. To optimize management of stroke patients outside of specialized units, a survey concerning practice was conducted in internal medicine departments in western France, and a meeting was held to define guidelines.METHODS: Data sheets were mailed to practitioners in internal medicine departments prior to the survey. The following data were recorded for each patient hospitalized during the two-week study: age, sex, clinical characteristics of stroke, risk factors, investigations performed, and initial and subsequent medical management. On the basis of the results, management guidelines were considered and defined.RESULTS: Patients hospitalized for a stroke in internal medicine departments have a similar profile to those hospitalized in neurology departments. CT-scan and EKG recordings were performed in most patients whereas other investigations (cervical ultrasound, echocardiography, MRI) were used less frequently. The use of rehabilitation and therapeutic strategies for secondary stroke prevention were not always performed according to current guidelines.CONCLUSION: Internal medicine departments are frequently involved in the care of stroke patients. The present study of clinical practice may help to improve stroke management in these non-specialized departments.",

Demographic data, main complaints, diagnosis, cancer status, etiology, and neuroradiologic studies were reviewed for the 528 consultations. Headache was the most frequent complaint (18.3%), followed by altered mental status (8.4%) and back pain (7.1%). Many children with these complaints had underlying structural disorders despite a normal neurologic examination. The symptoms varied with the underlying cancer and tumor status. Headaches were more common in patients with hematologic cancers, and back pain was more common in patients with solid tumors. Chronic headaches were frequent in patients in remission. Iatrogenic complications, particularly related to chemotherapy, constituted the largest etiologic group (27.7%). A high percentage of neuroradiologic studies were abnormal, and 63% of the magnetic resonance imagine studies were diagnostic. The broad spectrum of conditions underlying the neurologic complaints of children with systemic cancer illustrates the complexity of problems presented by these patients and requires a thorough knowledge of pediatric cancer, its effects on the nervous system, and the complications of its treatment from the neurology consultant.",

However, the effect of SjO2 on clinical neurologic findings is not known. S100beta is a possible surrogate biochemical marker of brain injury, and we report here the scored clinical neurologic findings in 98 patients from our previous study in relation to SjO2, cognitive performance, aortic atheroma, and S100beta. Patients underwent a scored neurologic examination and cognitive assessment the day before and 3 mo after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Intraoperatively, intermittent blood sampling was performed, and postoperatively, the area under the curve describing SjO2 <50% in relation to time was calculated from continuous jugular bulb reflectance oximetry. Palpation was used to assess the ascending aorta for the presence of atheroma. The jugular bulb concentration of S100beta was measured 6 h after completion of surgery. The neurologic score 3 mo after surgery did not correlate with either intra- or postoperative SjO2 (r = 0.111, P = 0.278; and r = -0.074, P = 0.467, respectively). The main determinant of neurologic score at 3 mo was the preoperative neurologic score (r(2) = 0.63, P < 0.001), whereas palpable atheroma of the ascending aorta made a small but significant contribution (r(2) = 0.034, P = 0.004). Neurologic and cognitive scores correlated before surgery (r = 0.226, P = 0.022) and at 3 mo after surgery (r = 0.348, P < 0.001). A preoperative neurologic deficit of two or more had a small but significant negative effect on cognitive performance at 3 mo (standardized beta = -0.097, P = 0.018). There was a significant univariate correlation between S100beta and the 3-mo neurologic score (r = -0.232, P < 0.05), but not a multivariate correlation (beta = -0.090, P = 0.156).IMPLICATIONS: Intraoperative jugular bulb oxyhemoglobin saturation (SjO2) and postoperative SjO2 <50% do not have an important influence on long-term neurologic outcome after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Subtle preoperative neurology is associated with long-term cognitive decline, and aortic atheroma is a risk factor for both cognitive and neurologic decline.",

In order to investigate the contribution of various neurophysiological examinations in the diagnosis in cervical spondylosis, we examined 70 patients suffering from cervical spondylosis, with peripheral nerve conduction studies, F-wave from the upper limb and electromyography from the corresponding muscles, as well as somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) from upper and lower limbs. Patients were separated into four groups: 20 patients had cervical spondylosis symptoms only; 15 patients had symptoms and signs of spinal root involvement; 15 patients had symptoms and signs of myelopathy; and 20 patients had symptoms and signs of both myelopathy and spinal root involvement. A group of 20 normal controls was also studied. In all groups of patients SEPs were the most sensitive electrophysiological study. Low-amplitude N13 and increased conduction time of N9-N13 and central conduction N13-N19 and LP-P27 were the most common finding in SSEP testing. SEPs were affected in many cases without CT-MRI findings of spinal cord pressure. From the above findings, SEPs proved to be the most sensitive diagnostic investigation in cervical spondylosis.",

By week 16, response rates were 82% (198) and 21% (16), respectively. The results for all other measures of efficacy were significantly better in the botulinum toxin group than the placebo group. Significantly higher patient satisfaction was reported in the botulinum toxin type A group than the placebo group (3.3 v 0.8, P<0.001 at 4 weeks). Adverse events were reported by only 27 patients (11%) in the botulinum toxin group and four (5%) in the placebo group (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: Botulinum toxin type A is a safe and effective treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis and produces high levels of patient satisfaction.",

Of these, 180 patients had poststroke first-time seizures (PFSs). We followed these 180 PFS patients for an average of 3.7 years or until death to determine the occurrence rate of SE. By comparing these data with those of PFS patients without SE, we investigated whether there were significant differences.RESULTS: A total of 17 of the 180 PFS patients (9%) had SE. There was no relationship between the occurrence of SE and stroke risk factors, stroke type (ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke), stroke topography and cause, cortical involvement, size of lesion, seizure type, or electroencephalographic findings. SE occurred more frequently among patients with a higher disability rating (Rankin scale >3; odds ratio, 4.36). Recurrent SE was identified in 5 of 17 patients with SE. In all 5 of these patients, the first episode of SE occurred within the first 7 days after stroke (early-onset SE). Statistical analysis demonstrated that early-onset SE was associated with a higher risk for SE recurrence (P=0.003) and a higher mortality rate (P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: SE was not associated with a higher mortality rate but with higher functional disability. We also found that early-onset SE (within the first 7 days after stroke) was associated with a higher risk for SE recurrence and a higher mortality rate than late-onset SE (after 7 days after stroke).",

We collected 28 AHC patients, and studied their clinical courses and the effects of drug therapy. All of the patients had received flunarizine. In 18 of the 28 patients, flunarizine reduced the severity, duration, or frequency of the hemiplegic attacks. No other drug was more effective than flunarizine. Some flunarizine non-effective patients were severely deteriorated, for example, they had dementia or were ventilator-assisted. Flunarizine had not only a short-term effect, i.e. it reduced the hemiplegic attacks, but also a long-term effect on the motor and intellectual development in some patients with AHC. Flunarizine is still an essential drug for treating AHC.",

The ALS CARE Database has been collecting data on the management of patients with ALS in North America since 1996.OBJECTIVE: To compare the management of patients with ALS in North America as recorded in the ALS CARE Database with the recommendations of the AAN ALS Practice Parameter.METHODS: Data were analyzed from 2018 patients at enrollment and from 373 of these patients who died between enrollment and May 1999.RESULTS: Eighty-two percent of the enrolled patients reported that they had been given enough information about ALS. Only 54% of patients with drooling were receiving medication for this problem. Only 41% of those who reported being depressed most of the time were receiving antidepressant medications. Only 28% of those with dyspnea and only 9.2% of those with a forced vital capacity <40% predicted were receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilator support. Only 30% of those with moderate to severe dysphagia had a gastrostomy tube. Half of the patients who died did so at home, but only 47% of them received residential hospice services. Although 89% of patients who died were recorded as having done so peacefully, 17% were reported to have had breathing difficulties (i.e., respiratory distress), 8% anxiety, 3.3% pain, and 2.5% choking. Advance directives were in place for 90% of the patients who died, and in 97% of cases these directives were followed.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that in the 3-year period prior to the publication of the AAN Practice Parameter, many but not all patients received the care that is recommended in that parameter; there were deficiencies, particularly in the key areas of gastrostomy and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.",

This decision depends on therapeutic as well as economic considerations. However in depression, as in other mental illnesses, many cases could reasonably be treated as in- or outpatients alike. Despite the importance of this question, there is to our knowledge no epidemiological study which compares patients in inpatient and outpatient settings within the current German medical system. 1300 inpatients and 5376 outpatients were investigated using identical methodologies within a drug utilization study of the antidepressant venlafaxine. Inpatients were found to be more severely ill and have a recurrent course of illness and higher rates of comorbidity. Outpatients more often had a chronic course. Inpatients were treated more often and with a wider variety of medication than outpatients, with the exception of phytopharmaceuticals. Venlafaxine was given in higher doses in the inpatient setting and combined more often with other psychotropic medications. Complaints of adverse drug reactions were comparable in both groups. Nausea was the most frequent, reported by 9.7% of inpatients and 15.2% of outpatients. The data show that the distribution of patients in outpatient and inpatient settings corresponds to the stepwise structure of the German health care system.",

They include detection of abnormal genes in common degenerative and metabolic diseases, clarification of brain mechanisms of movement and cognition with neurophysiology including unit recording from basal ganglia neurons, neuroimaging and neuropsychology tests. Treatment of intractable chronic diseases has also progressed. Medical, surgical and immunosuppressive treatment for Parkinson's disease, immunological diseases, and for certain metabolic diseases are examples. Neurologists in Japan contributed in research progress in the various fields. However, services in clinical medicine have devoted mainly in neurodegenerative, immunological diseases and myopathy. Promotion of nationwide clinical service for cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy and dementia is required. Research in neurology in the next century should be promoted in various fields with different methodology and targets; genes, molecular mechanisms, cellular activity, neural networks, brain as a whole and a human subject. Particularly integrated function of he brain shall be studied thoroughly not only from biological but also from psychological and social point of view. Leaders in neurology in Japan, particularly professors of neurology have been asked to chair all the activities of education, research and clinics. Merits of this system were reflected in connection of clinical and research data, resulting in establishment of new disease showing unusual combination of symptoms and signs. In future, coordination among specialists in different fields are required for further promotion of clinical researches and training of neurologists.

Data from 2000 patients with acute stroke (n=1761) or transient ischaemic attack (n=239) admitted consecutively to the department of neurology of an acute care 350 bed teaching hospital were prospectively collected in the Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona stroke registry over a 10 year period. For the purpose of the study 222 (12.7%) patients with pure motor stroke were selected. The other study groups included 218 (12.3%) patients with other lacunar strokes and 1321 (75%) patients with non-lacunar stroke. In relation to stroke subtype, lacunar infarcts were found in 189 (85%) patients, whereas ischaemic lacunar syndromes not due to lacunar infarcts occurred in 23 (10.4%) patients (atherothrombotic stroke in 12, cardioembolic stroke in seven, infarction of undetermined origin in three, and infarction of unusual aetiology in one) and haemorrhagic lacunar syndromes in 10 (4.5%). Patients with pure motor stroke showed a better outcome than patients with non-lacunar stroke with a significantly lower number of complications and in hospital mortality rate, shorter duration of hospital stay, and a higher number of symptom free patients at hospital discharge. After multivariate analysis, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, non-sudden stroke onset, internal capsule involvement, and pons topography seemed to be independent factors of pure motor stroke in patients with acute stroke. In conclusion, about one of every 10 patients with acute stroke had a pure motor stroke. Pure motor stroke was caused by a lacunar infarct in 85% of patients and by other stroke subtypes in 15%. Several clinical features are more frequent in patients with pure motor stroke than in patients with non-lacunar stroke.",

The aim of this study was to correlate such parameters with positron emission tomography (PET) with levodopa tagged with 6-fluorine 18, an established imaging method for striatal dopaminergic neurons.METHODS: Twenty-three patients in different disease stages (Hoehm and Yahr stage 2.5-5 [Hoehn MM, Yahr MD. Parkinsonism: onset, progression and mortality. Neurology 1967;4:427-42]; median duration, 12 years) were studied. PK-PD modeling followed a single oral dose of levodopa/benserazide. The sum score of the Columbia Rating Scale (CURSSigma) was used for clinical assessments. A nonparametric effect compartment approach assuming a sigmoidal E(max) model was applied to the PK-PD analysis of plasma levodopa concentrations and corresponding CURSSigma. Thereafter 6-[18F]levodopa PET was performed, and the influx rate constants (k(c)) for the putamen and the caudatus region were correlated with the median effective concentration (EC(50)) and the equilibrium half-life (T(eq)) of the PK-PD model.RESULTS: (1) A significant correlation was observed between PK-PD parameters or with k(c) putamen as the dependent variable and the duration of the disease as the independent variable, which explains 33% of the variability of the EC(50), 42% of the variability of T(eq), and 36% of the variability of k(c). (2) Significant correlations were observed between k(c) and either EC(50) or T(eq), yielding the closest correlation for the putamen region (r = -0.47, P <.05; and r = 0.55, P <.01; respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that key parameters of a PK-PD model of levodopa were in fairly close agreement with imaging of dopaminergic neurons by 6-[18F]levodopa PET. However, although PK-PD modeling of levodopa has been proven as a useful investigation of approaches aimed to restore dopaminergic deficits or to monitor disease progression, this modeling cannot serve as a pathomorphologic surrogate for the loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons.",

Since his graduation from medical school there in 1951, Dr. Gotoh has devoted himself to neurology, especially in the enigmatic field of stroke science. He is most renown for his groundbreaking research and leadership in the study of cerebral blood flow and metabolism. Beginning with his doctoral thesis paper in 1959 entitled \"Effects of blood pressure on cerebral circulation,\" our article briefly delineates how Prof. Gotoh has paved the path for current and future discoveries in modern medicine. Although wholly difficult to sum up Dr. Gotoh's extensive career in such a short article, we have attempted to chronologically list and furthermore to describe his numerous works. Herein we describe his expansion to the international arena with his contributions at Wayne State University as well as his novel cerebral blood gas monitoring techniques now used in modified fashion throughout the world. From his CO2-based investigations in animals to his study of the autonomic nervous system's role in human cerebrovascular control, we remark on Dr. Gotoh's accomplishments without the use of functional imaging. Yet despite the basic science theme of his research, he has always kept them clinically correlated to entities such as Cheyne-Stokes phenomenon and Shy-Drager syndrome. Prof. Gotoh has been asked to head some of the most influential stroke societies and was the second president of the International Stroke Society. In conjunction with leading authorities, he developed a quantifiable, evidence-based stroke scale which was introduced in the International Journal of Stroke in 2001. Today despite his retirement, Dr. Gotoh continues his work in cerebral blood flow and metabolism.",

The features of posttraumatic headache may vary, but the most distressing type is the chronic daily headache. This study evaluates occurrence of chronic daily headache in relation to the intensity of head injury.METHODS: All patients with head injury who were seen by the senior author (J.R.C.) in the Southern Illinois University Medical School (SIUMS) Neurology Clinic between 1980 and 1991 were identified from the SIUMS headache registry. Data on headache status before and after head injury was obtained, and patients with more than one headache per week before head injury were excluded. Each patient's headache status at the time of the clinic visit was classified as chronic daily headache (headache occurring at least 5 of 7 days for 6 months), intermittent migraine, or no headache. Head injury severity was graded by duration of loss of consciousness or amnesia as minimal (less than 5 minutes), mild (5 to 60 minutes), moderate (1 to 24 hours), or severe (more than 24 hours).RESULTS: There was an inverse relation between extent of head injury and occurrence of chronic daily headache. For minimal head injury (n = 54), 80% had chronic daily headache, and 11% had no headache, while for moderate/severe head injury (n = 23), only 27% had chronic daily headache, and 68% had no headache (P<.001, chi2).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the risk of developing posttraumatic chronic daily headache is greater for less severe head injury compared with moderate/severe head injury. The reason for this relation is unclear.",

Analyses were conducted on the ECLW CS data set, which consists of 14,717 psychiatric C-L referrals made in 56 European hospitals during 1991. Psychiatric referrals of patients admitted to neurological wards were compared to referrals from other wards. Information was obtained from 33 neurological wards, consisting of 34,506 neurological admissions. Of these admissions, 839 were referred to C-L psychiatry. The median consult rate among the hospitals was 1.8%. Compared to other hospital wards, patients referred from neurology were more frequently diagnosed as suffering from somatoform (P<.01) and dissociative disorders (P<.01), and less from substance abuse (P<.01) and delirium (P<.01). Referral to C-L psychiatry from neurological wards is characterized by an underestimation of psychiatric co-morbidity and a late detection, comparable to other medical specialties. An appeal is made for a standardized referral procedure including admission screening method, detecting patients at risk for nonstandard care during their hospital admission.",

ICAM-1 genes may contribute to the inflammatory events responsible for the vessel damage in BD. We examined potential associations of ICAM-1 gene polymorphisms with BD susceptibility.METHODS: Case patients were 74 consecutive Italian patients with BD who were followed at the Bologna, Ferrara, Milano, Potenza, Prato, Reggio Emilia, and Trento rheumatology, ophthalmology, and neurology units over a 3 year period (1997-99) who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD; 228 healthy Italian blood donors from the same geographic areas were selected as control groups. All BD patients and controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide techniques for ICAM-1 polymorphisms at codon 241 (exon 4) and codon 469 (exon 6).RESULTS: The frequency of R241 was significantly higher in BD patients than in controls (20.3% vs 5.7%; p = 0.001, pcorr = 0.002, OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.9-9.3). The distribution of E/K 469 genotype was similar in patients and controls. Comparing patients with different clinical features, we found only a trend to higher frequency of R241 in patients with articular manifestations (21.4% vs 12.5%; p = 0.08).CONCLUSION: Our findings show that G/R 241 polymorphism of ICAM-1 is associated with BD susceptibility.",

Preoperative assessment included clinical evaluation of muscle weakness, edrophonium testing, electromyography, lung function testing, chest X-rays and CAT scans. Symptoms were assessed by the Osserman scale. The surgical approach was amplified transsternal thymectomy. The prognostic factors studied were sex, age, clinical stage, duration of disease before surgery and histology of the thymus. Clinical outcome was assessed using Millichap and Dodge's criteria. Follow-up was by the chest surgery and neurology departments.RESULTS: Complete remission was observed in 29 cases (36.2%) and significant improvement in 42 (52.5%). Complications developed in 9 patients (11.2%). Most patients were women (53/27) and outcomes for men and women were not statistically different. Mean age was 36 years (range 11-79), with no significant difference in outcome for patients who were older or younger than 60 years of age. Nor were differences evident related to presurgical clinical stage or levels of severity (I + IIa/IIb + III). Differences in outcome were highly significantly related to duration of disease (< 24 / > 24 months) (p = 0.0022), such that outcome was more satisfactory when the pre-surgical course of disease was shorter, provided that no thymoma was present.CONCLUSIONS: Amplified transsternal thymectomy was safe and effective for those patients with MG. When disease had been present for less than two years, the prognosis was better.",

      "abstractText": "UNLABELLED: The new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) was first described in the UK in 1996 (16). The nvCJD differs from sporadic, genetic and iatrogenic CJD. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is closely associated with an abnormal isoform PrPSc of a cell-surface glycoprotein, prion protein (14). Molecular analysis suggests that nvCJD is caused by the same prion strain as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (4, 10). To the end of September 2000, there have been 82 cases of nvCJD in the UK. We report the second French case of nvCJD to our knowledge (5, 13).CASE REPORT: This 36 year old woman was referred by a local general practitioner with a 6 month history of psychiatric symptoms of major depressive disorder. According to her family, the patient had suffered from personality change for several months before the onset of depression including apathy, emotional lability, infantile affect. There was no history of health problems. As she was admitted to the psychiatric department of our hospital in Paris suburbs, she presented a major depressive disorder. There were no specific psychiatric features allowing distinction from common depressive disorders, except a marked emotional lability. The patient's condition progressed rapidly within the following days. She presented memory impairment and disorientation. Drug treatments, clomipramine (125 mg/day) and venlafaxine (200 mg/day), were used with no benefit. She presented subsequently transient delusions and auditory hallucinations, fleeting for some hours. The predominant delusional themes were somatic type and pregnancy. The delusions were concomitant with delusions of the onset of cognitive impairment. The patient tested negative for the P 14.3.3 protein in the CSF. Computed tomography scan of the brain did not show any relevant abnormality. The electroencephalogram showed non specific slow wave activity. The neurological symptoms developed 7 months after the onset of depressive symptoms including ataxia, myoclonus, excessive daytime drowsiness, headache. After the onset of neurological symptoms, the illness progressed rapidly over the next 2 months with cognitive impairment, particularly memory impairment, myoclonus, ataxia, incontinence of urine and progressive immobility leading to dependency. CSF tests were negative. She was referred to a neurology department where the diagnosis was confirmed by brain biopsy (detailed elsewhere). The patient died in a state of akinetic mutism.DISCUSSION: The clinical features of our patient were consistent with previous descriptions of nvCJD, mainly those of the National CJD Surveillance Unit studies (17): early psychiatric symptoms, prolonged duration of illness (median: 14 months), earlier age at death, compared with sporadic CJD. Psychiatric symptoms occur in the clinical course in about a third of cases of sporadic CJD (3). In contrast, of the 35 cases that have died of nvCJD identified in the study by Will et al. (17), 34 suffered from early and prominent psychiatric symptoms, mainly depression and anxiety. In most of the patients, the first symptoms were psychiatric. Drug treatment was used in most cases, some patients had a transient improvement (18). The patient without psychiatric symptoms reported by the NCJDSU (17) was emotionally labile. Infantile affect and emotional lability, found in our patient, are frequently reported in other studies (1, 18). Schizophreniform disorders have been described during the clinical course, with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions (17, 18). The insomnia and excessive daytime drowsiness our patient presented have been described in similar cases (18). Investigations are important to rule out alternative diagnoses. EEG records do not show periodic triphasic complexes as in sporadic CJD. The P 14.3.3 protein in the CSF is positive in half the cases of nvCJD (17). First neurological symptoms developed 6 months after the onset of psychiatric symptoms including ataxia, myoclonus and persistent painful sensory symptoms (17, 18). In most of the cases, MRI brain scans show bilateral pulvinar high signal (17), found subsequently in our patient and detailed elsewhere (13). The terminal stages are progressive cognitive impairment, helplessness and akinetic mutism.CONCLUSION: The first symptoms of this patient were purely psychiatric and difficult to distinguish from common psychiatric disorders. Clinical surveillance of human prion disease is crucial in France, as in UK. The link with BSE has dramatically highlighted the need for neurological and neuropsychological precise investigations.",

Dom Pedro II became a close friend of Charcot and he was a distinguished guest at Charcot's house, particularly at Tuesday soir?es on boulevard St. Germain. In 1887, during the visit of Dom Pedro II to France, Charcot evaluated him and made the diagnosis of surmenage. In 1889, Dom Pedro II was disposed and went to Paris, where he lived until his death in 1891. Charcot signed the death certificate and gave the diagnosis of pneumonitis. Charcot had a passionate affection for animals, a feeling shared by Dom Pedro II. Dom Pedro II was affiliated to the French Society for the Protection of Animals. It is conceivable that Charcot's little monkey, from South America, was given to him by Dom Pedro II. The Brazilian Neurological School was founded by Professor A. Austreg?silo in 1911, in Rio de Janeiro. At the time, of Charcot's death in 1893, his influence was still very important in the whole world. He and his pupils played a major role in the development of Brazilian Neurology.CONCLUSION: Professor Charcot had a close relationship with the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II. He was his private physician and they were close friends. The neurological school, created by professor Charcot, contributed significantly, albeit in an indirect way, to the development of Brazilian Neurology, starting in 1911, in Rio de Janeiro, by Professor A. Austreg?silo.",

In 10 children, there were data for clinically definite or laboratory-supported definite multiple sclerosis. The other 15 children in our study were considered as having suspected multiple sclerosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in 15 children disclosed multiple hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging in 13 children: 10 with definite multiple sclerosis and 3 with suspected multiple sclerosis. The clinical manifestations did not always correspond to the size and location of the MRI lesions of demyelination. Follow-up revealed normalization of the neurologic examination in 18 patients (72%) and abnormal neurologic findings in 7 patients (28%) (6 children with definite multiple sclerosis and 1 with suspected multiple sclerosis). Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up in children with definite multiple sclerosis disclosed a reduction in the size of the lesions in 3; enlargement or new lesions were established in the other 7 cases, and 2 cases were without clinical signs of new attacks. Correlation was done concerning the findings of the cerebrospinal fluid examination, transcranial magnetic stimulation, evoked potentials, computed tomography, and MRI. The role of MRI for an early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in children is discussed. The dynamic follow-up of the pathologic changes is of prognostic significance for the course of the disease that could be a definite cessation of the process in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis cases or transition to multiple sclerosis.",

Data about the illness, family and personal history and physical exploration were picked up. EEG, CT, MRI and carotid arteriography were performed.RESULTS: The main prevalence was 25 to 29 years (15.3%) and those older than 60 years (14.3%). We determined the diagnosis in 56% of the patients. Stroke was present in 19.3%, degenerative diseases in 16.6%, cerebral tumors in 9%, severe cranial trauma in 7.6% and infections, perinatal damage and toxic and metabolic causes in 3.3%.CONCLUSIONS: The symptomatic epilepsy is the most frequent type of late-onset epilepsy, the vascular and degenerative etiology are the most important in those older than 40 years old, these findings are similar to those of the developed countries.",

Patients were asked to provide demographic data and complete the self-efficacy scale along with the following validated scales: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Impact, Stigma and Mastery and Rankin Scales. The Rankin Scale and Barthel Index were also assessed by the physician.RESULTS: A new 11-item self-efficacy scale was constructed consisting of two domains of control and personal agency. The validity of the scale was confirmed using Cronbach's alpha analysis of internal consistency (alpha = 0.81). The test-retest reliability of the scale over two weeks was acceptable with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.79. Construct validity was investigated using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient resulting in significant correlations with depression (r= -0.52) anxiety (r =-0.50) and mastery (r= 0.73). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that these factors accounted for 70% of the variance of scores on the self-efficacy scale, with scores on mastery, anxiety and perceived disability being independently significant.CONCLUSION: Assessment of the psychometric properties of this new self-efficacy scale suggest that it possesses good validity and reliability in patients with multiple sclerosis.",

Although the disease is considered to be a type of cervical myelopathy, the mechanism remains unknown. An immunological study of five consecutive patients with this disorder who were examined in the neurology clinic at Kyushu University Hospital during the past 2 years were performed. All developed distal muscular atrophy and weakness of one or both upper limbs in the second decade, and showed forward displacement of the dural sac and passive dilatation of the posterior venus plexus at the lower cervical portion on MRI during neck flexion. Four of the five patients had one or more coexistent airway allergies, such as allergic rhinitis, pollinosis, and asthma, and all five patients had a family history of atopic or allergic disorders in close relatives. Four of the five patients had mild eosinophilia. All five patients commonly had IgE specific to two mite antigens, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae, whereas three of them also showed a raised total serum IgE concentration. The frequency of mite antigen specific IgE was significantly higher in the present patients with Hirayama disease than in 82 healthy controls (26/82, p<0.005). These findings suggest that atopy may be one of the contributing factors for Hirayama disease.",

We consider that it would be useful if the use of health-care resources for attending these patients was to be evaluated and studied by the neurologists who direct them.OBJECTIVE: To analyze a predetermined series of variables related to strokes in our setting. Patients and methods. We made a descriptive analysis by means of a questionnaire, recording variables related to the admission to the neurology department of patients with probable ACVA, at 100 days and with further evaluation 6 months later.RESULTS: We recorded 107 cases with ACVA confirmed in 101 of 104 patients with averages of: 70.54 years, average admission 13.53 days and intrahospital mortality 5.8%. The most common neurological findings were paralysis and speech disorder. The proportion of ischaemic stroke as compared with haemorrhagic stroke was 87.5% to 12.5%. The prevalence of usual risk factors was: arterial hypertension, diabetes and cardiopathy. The percentage of patients given rehabilitation treatment during their admission was 41.34%. A proportion, 37.2%, of the patients were referred to Hospital San Rafael for convalescence and treatment. The average time before evaluation by a neurologist was 30.23 hours. Eleven of 86 patients who answered a weekly questionnaire died (12.8%) and 54/86 had no rehabilitation treatment during the week (62.8%).CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences in the epidemiological characteristics as compared with other studies. The excessive lapse of time before attending the emergency department was striking, as was the delay in receiving neurological attention since there was no emergency neurologist available and fewer haemorrhagic strokes since there was no neurosurgical service available. There was little use of salicylates as a platelet anti-aggregrant agent on discharge from hospital, little rehabilitation treatment six months after the stroke, and twice as much mortality as when the patients were in hospital. We consider that a more detailed and extensive analysis would be fully justified in our setting, preferably with more people interested in the early and late treatment of ACVA taking part and prolonged follow-up of these patients.",

All were subjected to a CT scan, carotid duplex-Doppler ultrasonographic examination with Doppler measurement of blood flow velocity, permeability and plaques. Cardiac emboli were searched with transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography.RESULTS: One hundred ten patients (39 women), aged 67.5 +/- 11.4 years old were studied. Stroke was atherothrombotic in 46 (41.8%), embolic in 30 (27.3%), lacunar in 27 (24.6%) and of other type in 7 (6.4%). Ninety two patients (84.4%) had high blood pressure, 38% had high cholesterol levels, 35% had a cardiac disease and 26% were smokers. Thirty five subjects (31.8%) had a normal carotid ultrasonography, 46 (41.8%) had mural plaques, 16 (14.5%) had multiple plaques without occlusion, 13 (11.8%) had a partial occlusion and 7 (6.4%) had a total occlusion. Logistic regression analysis disclosed no significant relationship between stroke types and carotid atherosclerosis. Age was the only significant predictor for carotid atherosclerosis.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of severe carotid atherosclerosis in this group of stroke patients was less than expected.",

New research and clinical developments warrant an update of some aspects of diagnosis.METHODS: Studies published in English from 1985 through 1999 were identified that addressed four questions: 1) Are the current criteria for the diagnosis of dementia reliable? 2) Are the current diagnostic criteria able to establish a diagnosis for the prevalent dementias in the elderly? 3) Do laboratory tests improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of dementing illness? 4) What comorbidities should be evaluated in elderly patients undergoing an initial assessment for dementia?RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on evidence in the literature, the following recommendations are made. 1) The DSM-III-R definition of dementia is reliable and should be used (Guideline). 2) The National Institute of Neurologic, Communicative Disorders and Stroke--AD and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised (DSM-IIIR) diagnostic criteria for AD and clinical criteria for Creutzfeldt--Jakob disease (CJD) have sufficient reliability and validity and should be used (Guideline). Diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia may be of use in clinical practice (Option) but have imperfect reliability and validity. 3) Structural neuroimaging with either a noncontrast CT or MR scan in the initial evaluation of patients with dementia is appropriate. Because of insufficient data on validity, no other imaging procedure is recommended (Guideline). There are currently no genetic markers recommended for routine diagnostic purposes (Guideline). The CSF 14-3-3 protein is useful for confirming or rejecting the diagnosis of CJD (Guideline). 4) Screening for depression, B(12) deficiency, and hypothyroidism should be performed (Guideline). Screening for syphilis in patients with dementia is not justified unless clinical suspicion for neurosyphilis is present (Guideline).CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic criteria for dementia have improved since the 1994 practice parameter. Further research is needed to improve clinical definitions of dementia and its subtypes, as well as to determine the utility of various instruments of neuroimaging, biomarkers, and genetic testing in increasing diagnostic accuracy.",

Critical to this goal is the education of physicians during their residency training.METHODS: Resident physicians in Los Angeles who were in family practice (18%), internal medicine (51%), emergency medicine (20%), and neurology (11%) and had already completed their first year of training responded to a questionnaire on stroke and the treatment of carotid stenosis.RESULTS: Of the 266 respondents, 76% had heard of the \"brain attack\" campaign, 22% did not identify dysarthria as a symptom of stroke, and 21% did not identify obtundation as a presentation of stroke. Twenty-eight percent chose not to use tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke, and 60% recognized the need to begin treatment within 3 hours. More than 90% of respondents were able to identify correct screening tests for patients with suspected carotid stenosis. However, 56% responded that they would not advocate operating on patients with asymptomatic severe stenosis (>70%) until stenosis reached a critical value (85%). Conversely, 45% would recommend operative treatment for symptomatic patients who had less than 60% stenosis. Sixty-eight percent would refer patients to vascular surgeons, 14% to neurosurgeons, and 17% to both for carotid endarterectomy.CONCLUSION: Recognition of stroke as a medical emergency is improving. However, significant progress can still be made in the recognition of stroke symptoms. Primary care and neurology residents remain skeptical about carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic patients, whereas there is enthusiasm for treating stroke survivors. Education by members of the surgical community could promote the aggressive treatment of asymptomatic patients to prevent stroke.",

In this study we examined the utility of performing routine laboratory testing for syphilis in neurological patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We registered all in-patients in the Department of Neurology with a confirmed diagnosis of syphilis during a ten-year period (1990-1999). Additionally, we calculated the cost of performing laboratory tests of all hospitalised patients in this period.RESULTS: From a total of 8,637 patients, we identified five patients with syphilis, one of them with neurosyphilis. This patient had impaired cognitive functions at the time of admittance and a broad spectrum of neurological deficits suggesting a serious neurological disease. A positive syphilis serology confirmed the diagnosis and treatment was initiated. The mean cost for Treponema pallidum serological screening in neurological patients during 10 years was calculated to be about NOK 17,000 per year.INTERPRETATION: Tertiary syphilis is a serious disease with symptoms often mimicking other diseases. Although the laboratory tests for syphilis have been performed in every in-patient admitted to the neurological ward, a speedier diagnosis of neurosyphilis could not be detected in any patient in a ten-year hospital material. Routine serological examination for syphilis in neurological patients is therefore not recommended in this geographical area.",

The prevalence of family members at risk of having this disorder is 159.33 per 100 thousand in this province. The main neurophysiological abnormality observed was reduction in the amplitudes of sensory potentials. These alterations are the expression of a predominantly axonal peripheral lesion with signs of myelin damage. Techniques of quantitative neurology were developed for evaluation of the main disorders of coordination such as asymmetry and adiadochokinesis. In Cuba 125 families have hereditary ataxia, 772 patients and 8 to 10,000 family members are at risk of developing this condition. Seventy percent of the patients with ataxia are concentrated in Holguin province. The most severely affected towns are B?guanos (a rate of 129.20 per 100,000 inhabitants), Holguin (71.85 per 100,000) and Cacoc?m (69.83 per 100,000). These are the highest rates in the world.CONCLUSIONS: The commonest molecular form in Cuba is the SCA2, observed in 120 families. Clinically it is characterized by a cerebellar syndrome associated with disorders of eye movements and osteotendinous reflexes.",

Neurologic, cognitive, functional, and laboratory assessments were done semiannually for up to 30 months. Human immunodeficiency virus-dementia was diagnosed using American Academy of Neurology criteria for probable HIV-1-associated dementia complex.RESULTS: One hundred forty-six nondemented patients were enrolled, 45 of whom subsequently met criteria for incident HIV-D. In univariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, the following variables were significantly associated with time to develop dementia: cognitive: abnormal scores on Timed Gait, Verbal Fluency, Grooved Pegboard, and Digit Symbol tests; attention-memory, psychomotor, and executive function domain scores; and the diagnosis of minor cognitive/motor disorder; neurologic and medical: increased abnormalities on the neurologic examination, extrapyramidal signs, history of HIV-related medical symptoms; functional: higher reported role or physical function difficulties. Depression was also a strong risk factor, along with sex, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and beta2-microglobulin levels. In a multivariate model that used cognitive domain scores, covariates with significant hazard ratios included depression, executive dysfunction, and the presence of minor cognitive/motor disorder.CONCLUSION: Cognitive deficits, minor cognitive/motor disorder, and depression may be early manifestations of HIV-D.",

Thirty two skulls excavated at Hawara in the Fayum (northern Egypt), where most of the portraits were found were measured, and nine caliper measures on each side of the skulls were taken. The right/left ratios were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). One skull was subjected to 3D CT scanning and transilluminated.RESULTS: Two patients were found with progressive facial hemiatrophy (Parry-Romberg syndrome), three with deviations of the visual axes (tropia) and one with oval pupils (corectopia).CONCLUSIONS: Clinical paleoneurology is possible in the absence of a living nervous system. The patients probably had focal epilepsy, hemiplegic migraine, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction.",

Although the concept of CSW is well known in adult medicine, it is still not established in child neurology. We conducted a retrospective analysis of electrolyte disturbances in 195 children with various acute CNS diseases. In 20 children (10.3%) hyponatraemia with plasma sodium below 130 mmol/l was identified. On the basis of clinical and laboratory data 7 of these 20 children were diagnosed as having SIADH, and the other 9 children, as having CSW. Our data suggest that hyponatraemia attributable to CSW is at least as frequent in children as SIADH. Because of their different pathophysiological mechanisms, which require diametrically opposed therapeutic regimens, early differential diagnosis is mandatory if the correct treatment is to be given.",

The study included 571 enterococci strains isolated from urine in 1997. Species identification was performed by rapid ID32 STREP test (bioM?rieux) for 327 analyzed strains. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium dominated (46.1% and 11.2%, respectively). Over 42% of strains were isolated from urine of patients with non-significant bacteriuria or as concomitant flora. In such cases, simplified identification was performed and the strains were determined as Enterococcus spp. The microorganisms analyzed originated primarily from the urine samples of patients hospitalized at the Department of Urology (41.8%), the Department of Neurology (11.9%) and the Department of Internal Medicine and Nephrology (9.9%). Enterococcus faecalis strains were second with respect to population count (263--10.6%), after Escherichia coli strains (464--18.8%), while Enterococcus faecium strains were the sixth (64--2.5%). Enterococcus genus took the first place among all microorganisms isolated from the urine samples. Antibiotic-sensitivity was determined for 323 enterococci strains originating from hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Enterococcus faecium strains, naturally resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, were sensitive to nitrofuranoin in more than 50% and to norfloxacin in about 20%. Among 254 analyzed Enterococcus faecalis strains, 80.0% were sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and high concentrations of gentamicin as well as streptomycin. Enterococci strains isolated from hospitalized patients proved sensitive to ampicillin and carbapenems in 76.8%, while strains isolated from ambulatory patients were 100% sensitive to these drugs. Examination of enterococci isolated from urine of patients hospitalized showed 33.8% sensitive to norfloxacin and 84.6% sensitive to nitrofurantoin. All the enterococci strains were sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics: vancomycin, teicoplanin.",

The most promising advances in neurological and psychiatric diseases will require advances in neuroscience for their elucidation, prevention, and treatment. Technical advances have improved methods for identifying brain regions involved during various types of cognitive activity, for tracing connections between parts of the brain, for visualizing individual neurons in living brain preparations, for recording the activities of neurons, and for studying the activity of single-ion channels and the receptors for various neurotransmitters. The most significant advances in the past 20 years have come from the application to the nervous system of molecular genetics and molecular cell biology. Discovery of the monogenic disorder responsible for Huntington disease and understanding its pathogenesis can serve as a paradigm for unraveling the much more complex, polygenic disorders responsible for such psychiatric diseases as schizophrenia, manic depressive illness, and borderline personality disorder. Thus, a new degree of cooperation between neurology and psychiatry is likely to result, especially for the treatment of patients with illnesses such as autism, mental retardation, cognitive disorders associated with Alzheimer and Parkinson disease that overlap between the 2 disciplines.",

HRQoL was evaluated with the Medical Outcome Study-Short Form (SF-36) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). According to the classification criteria for chronic daily headache (CDH) proposed by Silberstein et al. (Neurology 47 (1996) 871) five hundred and ninety-three (66%) patients had CDH, of whom transformed migraine (TM) was diagnosed in 310, and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) in 231. One hundred and ninety-three patients had episodic migraine. All SF-36 scale scores significantly correlated with the HADS scores and the intensity and frequency of pain. Compared with the normative data, a pervasive multi-dimensional decline of the SF-36 scores was noted among the headache patients except for the physical functioning scale. The decline was most remarkable in the role limitations of physical and emotional dimensions and in the bodily pain. An increasing impairment of the SF-36 scores was noted from migraine to CTTH to TM. After controlling for the HADS, age, gender, education, and chronic illness by multiple linear regression analyses, the patients with TM had the worst SF-36 profile; whereas, the patients with CTTH and migraine had compatible results. This study is the first to demonstrate that the SF-36 scores differ among headache diagnoses. Psychological distress, as well as the percentages of the types of patients, greatly influenced the SF-36 scores in hospital-based headache samples. Our findings also suggest that improvement in the pain profile as well as psychological well-being can predict a generalized improvement in the SF-36 scales in headache patients.",

The main outcome measures were based on independent assessments at home and included mobility related disability (primary outcome: the Rivermead mobility index), gait impairments, arm function, mood, and subjective patient and carer ratings. Therapy was assessed by recording delivery, achievement of set targets, patient and carer preference, and cost.RESULTS: On the Rivermead mobility index (scale 0-15) (primary outcome) there was a highly significant (p<0.001) treatment effect of 1.4-1.5 units favouring hospital or home based therapy over no therapy: this was supported by other measures of mobility, gait, balance, and the assessor's global \"mobility change\" score: there was no major difference between home and hospital. Carers preferred home treatment but neither they nor patients discerned greater benefit there. Estimated costs of home physiotherapy were 25 pounds/session and those at hospital were 18 pounds (including 7 pounds patient travel costs).CONCLUSION: A course of physiotherapy is associated with improved mobility, subjective wellbeing, and improved mood in chronic multiple sclerosis compared with no treatment but benefit may only last a few weeks: there is little to choose between home and hospital based therapy but the first is more costly, mainly due to skilled staff travelling time.",

For control purposes, a partner or acquaintance with comparable living conditions was asked to do the same. The researchers judged whether falls were related to physical impairment (personal, intrinsic factors) or environmental factors (extrinsic factors).RESULTS: 59 patients with Parkinson's disease (21 women (36%); mean age: 60.8 years; mean Hoehn and Yahr score: 2.3) and 55 controls (37 women (67%); mean age: 59.6 years) were studied. Patients reported 205 falls and controls 10 falls. Recurrent (> or = 2) falls occurred in 15 patients (25%) and two controls (4%) (relative risk (RR): 9.0: 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.0-41.7). Recurrent falls were more common among persons using benzodiazepines (RR: 5.0: 95% CI: 1.6-15.5). Reliable information was obtained for 160 falls in patients. Most falls (79%) had an intrinsic cause, like turning around, standing up, bending and stumbling. Abrupt movements were a particularly frequent cause of falls. Simultaneous performance of multiple tasks contributed to almost 50% of falls in patients.CONCLUSION: Falls are common among Parkinson patients. Most falls are related to intrinsic factors. Prevention of these intrinsic falls requires treatment of the underlying postural instability. Use of benzodiazepines must be avoided whenever possible. Interventions aimed at extrinsic factors, such as reduction of domestic hazards, are possibly less effective.",

This mutation was modeled in Escherichia coli by changing Leu 259 (the equivalent residue) to Arg and the properties of the altered ECF(1)F(0) were compared to those of previously characterized ATPase6 mutants also modeled in the E. coli enzyme. The L259R change produced a fully assembled ECF(1)F(0) which had no significant ATP hydrolysis, ATP synthesis or proton pumping functions. This is very different from previously described human ATPase6 mutations. The presence of Arg at position 259 in subunit a did not make membranes permeable to protons.

These parameters suggest optimal care practices. To assess knowledge of the issues covered in the parameters and to facilitate educational efforts to promote best care, the Epilepsy Foundation conducted a survey of healthcare professionals likely to provide care to women with epilepsy. The survey sampled 3535 healthcare professionals across a wide range of specialties. Most respondents did not know the specific effects of estrogen and progesterone on the seizure threshold, were not aware of menstrual-associated seizure patterns, and could not identify which antiepileptic drugs interfere with oral contraceptives. The majority of respondents did not know that women with epilepsy have higher rates of infertility, reproductive endocrine disorders, and sexual dysfunction. Most respondents did not know the frequency of birth defects in children born to women with epilepsy. Providers seeing the largest number of persons with epilepsy were more likely to have correct answers. By specialty, neurologists provided the highest number of correct responses, followed (in descending order) by endocrinologists, obstetricians/gynecologists, internal medicine physicians, family practice physicians, and pediatricians. These results suggest that women with epilepsy are not receiving adequate counseling and that care practices may not conform to those recommended.",

Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force. Research criteria for diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Neurology, 1991;41:617-618). VEPs were performed in each case before and after 6 months treatment with either intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or steroids.RESULTS: Eight patients (47%) had increased latencies in at least one eye or showed increased interocular latency difference. Four patients (23%) presented a significant high signal intensity on T2-weighted brain MRI images. Of these 4 patients, 3 had prolonged VEP latency. Two patients with delayed VEP latency had antibodies against GM1, and SGLPG and anti-sulfatides, respectively. One patient with normal VEPs also had antibodies to GM1. VEP results were not significantly modified after treatment, either with steroids or IVIG.CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the high frequency of abnormal VEPs in CIDP patients, and found that they are poorly correlated with CNS demyelinating lesions and antibodies against glycolipids. The VEP abnormalities of these patients may be explained by the susceptibility to immune-mediated damage of both the peripheral nervous system and the optic nerve.",

We present a descriptive, epidemiological study about such a pathology in a general neurology clinic. We evaluated as the most relevant points the frequency of different types of headaches, the reasons for remission and diagnosis concordance with the remitting doctor, normally the General Practitioner.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The collection of data was carried out by means of structured interviews over a three month period. Apart from the epidemiological data of the subjects, the characteristics of the headache, the medication and its possible overuse, were also collected. A systematic neurological examination of all patients was carried out.RESULTS: 286 patients were included. The frequency of different diagnosis (the most frequent chronic daily headache, 39.2%), the number of patients who abused of analgesics (31.8%) and the diagnosis concordance with the referring doctor (20%) was analyzed among other variables.CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the high number of patients suffering from daily chronic headache and the fundamental role that the abuse of analgesics plays in this diagnostic entity. The diagnosis concordance is too low. A correct initial diagnosis as a result of a better neurological training in primary care would prevent in greater numbers the abuse of analgesics and would offer a better quality of care.",

However, sequelae of mild head injuries is complicated by many factors including a history of multiple head injuries and injury severity. Few studies have considered the influence these variables may have on proper classification of a MTBI and their meaning for return-to-play guidelines. This study presents the short-term neuropsychological and balance outcomes of four college athletes who sustained mild head injuries of different severity (grade I, grade II, grade III and multiple head injured with a grade II based on American Academy of Neurology guidelines). The results demonstrated that self-report symptoms of concussion were slow to resolve in the grade III and multiple concussed individuals. For neuropsychological testing, Trails A & B, Symbol Digit Modalities Test and Digits Span Backwards were the most sensitive in identifying differences between the injuries. For balance assessments using the Neurocom Smart Balance System, the Sensory Organization Test and Reaction Time were also important variables in detecting differences among the various injuries. When these data are used together, it can assist physicians in determining safe return-to-play for athletes who sustain MTBI. There are contradindications in the numerous grading systems and return-to-play guidelines for MTBI. The results from this study provides new evidence which can be assimilated into a valid grading scale for MTBI sustained in sport.",

The ethical committee of the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry approved this study and written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients. ECT was administered bilaterally twice a week using atropine, propofol, and succinylcholine (or vecronium) as anesthetic medications. The Hamilton rating scale for depression scores decreased from 30.5 +/- 11.0 to 14.8 +/- 11.5 following a course of 5-12 treatments. Memory and cognitive functioning, evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination, Short-Memory Questionnaire and so on, had not changed a week after the last ECT.

We prospectively studied the role of the neurologist in patient management, in a primary care university hospital. Over a period of 12 months, we prospectively recorded the demographics of patients requiring examination in the emergency room, the initial suspected neurological diagnosis of the emergency room, the final diagnosis of the neurology team, and the patients' outcomes. For each patient, the time between admission, the call and the neurological examination were recorded. Neurological examinations were performed in 2220 patients in whom 75.6 p.100 were performed in the emergency room. These latter patients corresponded to 14 p.100 of all patients admitted in the emergency room. Of examined patients, 52 p.100 were male and mean age was 56.9 +/- 21 years. The time between admission and examination was 32 min. (+/- 36 min), irrespective of the day of the week, and depended on the suspected diagnosis: shorter in stroke and status epilepticus (p<0.05), and longer in loss of consciousness and vertigo (p<0.01). Forty-four percent of the examinations took place in the evening and night. The reasons for examinations were: stroke (28.3 p.100), epilepsy (17.7 p.100), headaches (8.4 p.100), loss of consciousness (7.9 p.100), cognitive dysfunctions (4.1 p.100), neuropathies (4 p.100) and miscellaneous (8.1 p.100). Neurological examinations modified neurological diagnosis and treatment in more than 86 p.100 of the patients. Following neurological examination, 17.2 p.100 of the patients were able to go home, while the rest were admitted to the stroke unit (27.2 p.100), the general neurological unit (27.3 p.100) or in other departments (28.3 p.100), of which intensive care unit (5.3 p.100) or neurosurgery (5.9 p.100).

Mart?n Larios had shown behavioral disturbances and had married secretly for the second time against the advice of his family, one of the richest and more dominating families in Spain during the 19th century. In their report Charcot and Hardy gave a diagnosis of mental insanity probably due to general paresis, as they had noted memory deficits and delusion of grandeur. With this and other medical reports, the family tried to obtain the legal incapacity of Mart?n Larios. Initially the judgements favoured the incapacity, but Mart?n Larios and his wife appealed with the support of the Spanish doctors Jos? Mar?a Escuder, Jaime Vera and Luis Simarro. They demonstrated, in an exhaustive and clinically rigorous report, the normality of the mental status of Mart?n Larios, and refuted the diagnosis given by Charcot and Hardy. This report is one of the first examples of the clinical evaluation of a neurologic patient in Spain and shows the high clinical standards achieved by the precursors of the neurological school of Madrid. The great influence of Charcot's own school over Spanish neurology in its beginnings stands out in this report. Charcot and Hardy wrote a second report in reply to Escuder, Vera and Simarro. After a complex lawsuit, the opinion of the Spanish doctors finally prevailed against the legal incapacity of Mart?n Larios.",

Possible causes of misdiagnosis of BPPV were studied by review of the records of 191 patients referred to our neurology clinic; 36 were identified as having BPPV not previously diagnosed. On referral the patients carried the following diagnoses: unspecified dizziness/vertigo (33%), transient ischemic attacks (28%), cervicogenic vertigo (19%), psychogenic dizziness/vertigo (11%), and others (8%). The paroxysmal nature of the vertigo and position-precipitating factors were not spontaneously reported by 31%. Atypical, even bizarre, symptoms including dizzy sensations were reported by 19%, and neck pain and headache were cardinal symptoms that accompanied vertigo. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which is essential for the diagnosis of BPPV, was not performed in any of the patients prior to referral. 30 (83%) experienced complete resolution of signs and symptoms after the first physical treatment session. We conclude that non-paroxysmal, non-positional vertigo does not rule out BPPV. Atypical and even bizarre complaints of dizziness, as well as neck pain and headache could be cardinal symptoms of BPPV. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is mandatory in those complaining of dizziness and vertigo.",

Pupillometry is a method that can provide valuable data concerning the functioning of the autonomous nervous system. The system for recording the pupil reaction was developed in the Laboratory of Clinical Neurophysiology of the 1st Department of Neurology of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in co-operation with the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. This system is fully automated. It includes an infra-red video camera, which has the capacity to record in complete darkness, and an SLE (clinical photic stimulator) lamp. A software application automatically performed all the procedures. During the first experiment, one flash was administered. During the second experiment, a series of 25 flashes (1 Hz frequency) was administered. Fifty physically and mentally healthy subjects aged 23-48 years took part in the study. Means, standard deviations and ranges for all variables characterizing normal subjects during both experimental conditions are reported. Test/re-test results and comparisons of the two eyes are also reported. The combined use of these two experimental conditions in dynamic pupillometry may be a very useful tool in medical research. There are already reports on the usefulness of pupillometry in the research of various diseases, including depression and Alzheimer's disease. It is expected that it will also be a valuable research tool in the study of diabetes, alcoholism, myasthenia gravis, cancer, multiple sclerosis, etc.",

Riluzole (Rilutek) has been the first patented drug used in its specific treatment. In order to evaluate the tolerability profile of this molecule, a Pharmacovigilance study was undertaken in the Department of Neurology B at the Montpellier University Hospital. A total of 153 patients were studied and all observed side-effects were listed in the French bank of Pharmacovigilance. Riluzole induced one or more adverse effects in 50.3 per cent of patients. The most frequent were gastrointestinal disturbances, hepatotoxicity and asthenia. Dermatological, haematological, neuropsychiatric and metabolic side-effects were also reported. This study shows an acceptable safety profile for riluzole. Due to its mode of action, riluzole could potentially be used in the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases involving glutamate excitotoxicity. Subsequently, Pharmacovigilance will have to be carried out to establish the proper use of riluzole.",

      "abstractText": "The basal ganglia occupy a commanding place in neuroscience research, in clinical neurology and in biomedical education. The paucity of our understanding of the role of the basal ganglia in normal everyday life combined with our more extensive knowledge of their deficiencies in a variety of clinical syndromes is a potent spur to continuing investigation. That some of these neurodegenerative syndromes-such as Parkinson's disease-are already common only heightens the need for insight in the face of a population with increasing expectations of longevity. About a decade ago an explosion of information on the connectivity and immunocytochemistry of forebrain structures gave rise to concepts which have shaped the fabric of basal ganglia theory-'patch and matrix', 'disinhibition', 'parallel circuits'. Some of these ideas seemed to facilitate an understanding of the basal ganglia, others to render them more complex and impenetrable. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the work of the last decade has tended towards consolidation and refinement. However, several new developments are receiving attention, many of them related to disorders of the basal ganglia. The realisation that some forms of Parkinson's disease have a genetic determinant is gaining strength. The molecular biology of the dopaminergic synapse on the one hand and of the production of insoluble proteins on the other will clearly influence future research into therapeutic options and neuroprotection. The importance of apoptosis, neural plasticity and free radical formation remains unresolved but these are potential areas of promise. Meanwhile, scanning techniques for brain imaging are allowing real time investigation of the working striatum in normal and disordered humans and animals.We believe that the time is opportune for a broad review of current thinking on the basal ganglia in health and disease. The following articles are based on presentations given at a Symposium on the Neurobiology of the Basal Ganglia held at Glasgow University in July 1999 as part of the Summer Meeting of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland. The invited speakers were chosen to be wide ranging and contributions encompassed evolution, circuitry and receptors of the basal ganglia, striatal remodelling after dopamine loss, striatal functioning in humans with Huntington's disease and in primate models after midbrain fetal transplants, and the genetics of basal ganglia disorders. Short presentations and posters of current results supplemented the main presentations and some are also included amongst these reviews.",

Adults with suspected mtDNA disease in the North East of England were referred to a single neurology center for investigation over the 10-year period from 1990 to 1999 inclusive. We defined the genetic defect in these individuals. For the midyear period of 1997, we calculated the minimum point prevalence of mtDNA disease in the adults of working age (> 16-<60 years old for female subjects and <65 years old for male subjects) and the minimum prevalence of adults and children (<60 years for female subjects, <65 years for male subjects) at risk of developing mtDNA disease. mtDNA defects caused disease in 6.57 per 100,000 individuals in the adult population of working age, and 7.59 per 100,000 unaffected adults and children were at risk of developing mtDNA disease. Overall, 12.48 per 100,000 individuals in the adult and child population either had mtDNA disease or were at risk of developing mtDNA disease. These results reflect the minimum prevalence of mtDNA disease and pathogenic mtDNA mutations and demonstrate that pathogenic mtDNA mutations are a common cause of chronic morbidity. These findings have resource implications, particularly for supportive care and genetic counseling.",

Specifically, we examined comprehension and consequences of informed consent procedures in the field of stroke, characterized by an emergency setting, cognitive impairment and poor prognosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (or proxies) included in recent years in clinical studies conducted in our Neurology Department for evaluating treatment of acute phase cerebral ischemia were interviewed to determine their knowledge of the disease, its treatment, the study protocol and the legal regulations, and the affective and psychological consequences of the informed consent procedure.RESULTS: Among 72 patients included in 7 studies ([fibrinolytic agent: 3 (n = 43), anticoagulant agent: 1 (n = 4), neuroprotective drugs (n = 25)], [7 randomized studies, 6 double-blind versus placebo, 5 with a 6-hour inclusion time interval]), 15 died during the acute phase, 5 were lost to follow-up, 4 refused to participate and 7 gave very partial answers. Consent was signed by the patient in 15% of cases, the spouse in 50%, a descendant in 23%. These persons were aware of the spontaneous risk of death (85%) or definitive functional impairment (95%). Half of them thought a specific treatment existed, 11% had some idea of the mechanism of action of the proposed treatment while 67% learned about this mechanism from the information provided. Although they had received information, only 25% of the patients had knowledge of placebo and 7% of therapeutic risk. 37% expected complete recovery from the treatment, 44% partial recovery, and 13% were very disappointed by the outcome. 81% felt they were free to make their own decision. Although 86% did not know there was a law protecting them, 82% were in agreement with the requirement for their consent while 17% would have preferred to delay consent. Most wished to be given the opportunity to discuss the study again, after the acute phase, and to receive the results of the study.CONCLUSION: This study shows that most French stroke victims and their closest relatives are unaware of the law protecting persons in biomedical research and have poor knowledge of medical data after being given appropriate information. Even so, the quality of information increases the quality of the patient-physician relationship. Patients want to be free to make their own decision to consent to biomedical research, but their desire was more for good information than for the power to make their decision alone. Being asked to give informed consent in order to participate in a clinical study accentuates the affective and psychological consequences of stroke, a factor which should be taken into consideration during follow-up.",

The objective of our study was to study the morbid-mortality of neurological disorders.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a retrospective investigation of all the patients admitted to the Hospital Central de Beira, Mozambique, between 1 January 1996 and 30 June 1999. The source of information used was the clinical histories and data of the Statistics Department. The basis used for classification of the disorders was the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-1CD 9CM (3 digits).RESULTS: We found that neurological disorders were fifth in the classification of morbidity and third in mortality. Trauma, infections and vascular causes--in that order--were the most important factors in the morbidity of neurological diseases. The highest mortality rate was seen with infections, vascular and neoplastic etiologies. In our study we found disorders which several investigators consider to be almost nonexistent in Africa, such as multiple sclerosis, subacute combined degeneration of the cord and myasthenia gravis amongst others. The morbidity and mortality found for neurological diseases are similar, in general, to those described in Africa.CONCLUSION: The importance of neurological disorders in healthcare means that it is essential to have a specialist available for their management.",

[1973] Cancer Res. 33:1258-1264; McLeod and Penny [1969] J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 32:297-304; Postma et al. [1993] J Neurooncol. 15:23-27; Sandler et al. [1969] Neurology 19:367-374). Systemic administration of vincristine causes swelling of unmyelinated axons and disorientation of axonal microtubules (Tanner et al. [1998a1998a] J Comp Neurol. 395:481-492) at a time when it also produces allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia (Aley et al. [1996] Neuroscience 73:259-265; Authier et al. [1999] Neuroreport 10:965-968) and enhanced responsiveness in C-fibers in the rat (Tanner et al. [1998b] J Neurosci. 18:6480-6491). Because slowing of A-fiber conduction velocities had also been demonstrated (Tanner et al. [1998b] J Neurosci. 18:6480-6491), and mechanical hyperalgesia can occur secondary to damage to large diameter sensory afferents (Basbaum et al. [1991] Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 69:647-651; Coggeshall et al. [1993] Pain 52:233-242; Woolf and Mannion [1999] Lancet 353:1959-1964), we sought to determine whether vincristine also induced ultrastructural changes in myelinated A-fibers. Moreover, since systemic treatment with vincristine did not cause profound microtubule depolymerization in the unmyelinated axons of the peripheral nerve, we hypothesized that the drug's effects may be more extensive in the cell body, because in the spinal ganglion, the blood-nerve barrier is less restrictive. We used quantitative ultrastructural methods to analyze the microtubule cytoskeleton in myelinated axons in the mid-shaft of the saphenous nerve and in the sensory ganglion cells. Vincristine induced swelling of the whole nerve and an increase in the cross-sectional areas of myelinated axons but no loss of myelinated axons. There was a significant decrease in axonal microtubules, as well as microtubule disorganization, in myelinated fibers from vincristine-treated rats. In the spinal ganglion, vincristine induced swelling of large diameter sensory neurons and a build-up of neurofilaments in the cell bodies and proximal axons, suggestive of impaired anterograde axonal transport.",

This study aims at determining the epidemiologic and etiologic characteristics and the difficulty in treating SE under the existing medical practice conditions in a developing country such as Senegal. A retrospective study was therefore carried out based on SE medical files at the University Hospital of Dakar over the period January 1988 to December 1998, and included several hospital departments, i.e., paediatrics, infectious diseases and neurology. Over an 11-year period 697 cases were recorded; of these, 48.2% of patients were under 5 years of age. The seizures were generalized in 58.2% of cases, partial in 21.2%, partial secondarily generalized, or with an association of both clinical presentations in 20.6% of cases. The etiology was as follows: mainly infectious (67%), followed by resistant and/or unbalanced epilepsy (9.9%), epilepsy of vascular origin (8%), and various other causes. The overall mortality rate was 24.8%. A long period between the onset of clinical symptoms and hospital treatment was noted, with an average time lapse of 16.6 h before treatment. The drugs utilized were diazepam and phenobarbitol, administered by injection. The overall outcome could be improved by better management, i.e., better prevention and an efficient treatment of infectious diseases, a reduction in the time before treatment, and improved means of intensive care.",

Medicines from a General Practitioner (GP), pharmacy and 'other' sources utilized in the last month were determined, along with demographic data. Additional information was obtained from hospital notes.RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen MS patients responded to the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 79% (117/148). Responders differed from nonresponders only in age, with responders being significantly older than nonresponders (P = 0.011). Over one-third of medicines taken in the last month were nonprescription medicines (35%; 219/627). A gamolenic acid containing preparation was the most popular, purchased by 28% of patients. Fifteen percent (17/117) of MS patients had exceeded the recommended daily allowance of a vitamin (frequently vitamins A, D and E), and one exceeded the upper safe level for daily self-supplementation of vitamin A and D. Females spent significantly more than males in the previous month ( pound10. 09 compared with pound5.53, respectively; P = 0.022). Patients who were older, reported worsening MS symptoms in the last year and those who exhibited greater disability were more likely to have been prescribed medicines by a GP (P < 0.0005), although they were not more likely to self-prescribe or take alternative remedies (P > 0. 05). However, those with poorer mobility were significantly less likely to have purchased a pharmacy medicine in the last month (P = 0.033).CONCLUSIONS: MS patients were high users of nonprescription medicines. A typical subgroup of MS patients that spent more on nonprescription medicines could not be identified, aside from females. Furthermore, the strong predictors for increased use of prescription medicines (increasing age, severity of symptoms in the last year and poorer mobility) were not found for nonprescription medicines. Excessive intake of the fat soluble vitamins could lead to hypervitaminosis, the effects of which could exacerbate or mimic MS symptoms. Health professionals should be aware of these issues and counsel the MS patient accordingly, particularly as the majority purchased products from 'other' sources where typically there is no health-professional available to give advice. The limited use of pharmacy medicines by the more disabled patient could indicate a problem with access to the pharmacy, or could reflect the greater use of prescription medicines.",

      "abstractText": "In the beginning of the 19th century, many studies were devoted to the diseases of the nervous system in France, long before the work of Charcot. The researches of L?on Rostan on the cerebral softening (1819, 1823) were based on the anatomoclinic method developed by the School of Paris whose most famous representatives were Corvisart and Laennec for the study of heart and lung diseases. The researches of Rostan were performed in the Salp?tri?re hospital which was, at this time, an hospice for old women. Rostan was appointed Inspector of the Health service in the Salp?tri?re hospital in 1812 then Head of a department in 1818. He was 28 year old when he published his book \"Researches on the cerebral softening\" in 1819. Rostan was the first to describe the spontaneous cerebral softening as a special anatomoclinic entity distinct from encephalitis and apoplexy. He compared this entity to the senile gangrene and stated that it was related to the ossification of cerebral arteries. He described the pathologic features of the brain softening and also its clinical symptomatology in opposition to that of apoplexy. The concept of brain softening according to Rostan was harshly fought by the followers of the Broussais's physiological medicine (from Lallemand, 1830 to Calmeil, 1859) who claimed that all brain softenings were due to the inflammation process and thus should be described as encephalitis. In opposite, the ideas of Rostan were accepted and developed by others such as Carswell in England (1835), Abercrombie in Scotland (1836) and Andral in France (1827, 1840). These authors agreed that some type of cerebral softening was related to a disease of the arterial system. Nevertheless, the modern concept of brain softening was not definitively accepted before the description of the thromboembolic mechanisms by Virchow in Germany (1856) with the help of the microscope, and the anatomoclinic studies of Proust, Laborde and Prevost and Cottard in France (1866). The book of Rostan was dedicated to the \"Conseil G?n?ral des Hospices\" which was created in 1801 to unify the administration of the hospitals in Paris and became the \"Administration G?n?rale de l'Assistance Publique ? Paris\" in 1849. One hundred and fifty years after its publication, the work of L?on Rostan was outstanding by its modernity of the form as well as the substance.",

Studies of tissue plasminogen activator show an association between early signs of major infarction and poor outcome. The American Academy of Neurology and the American Heart Association recommend avoiding thrombolysis if early signs of major infarction are present.METHODS: We presented 25 scans (normals, acute infarctions, and old infarctions) to 3 academic neuroradiologists. A scoring sheet based on Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke (ATLANTIS)/CT Summit criteria was used to determine >1/3 MCA territory involvement. Nine of the 25 scans were presented again to assess intrarater reliability. We recalculated results of our previous study in which physicians interpreted infarction scans, now designating the scans as >1/3 MCA, <1/3 MCA, or normal, as determined by the neuroradiologists.RESULTS: All 3 neuroradiologists agreed on no infarction, <1/3 MCA, and >1/3 MCA on 64% of the scans. Neuroradiologist test-retest agreement was 96% for >1/3 MCA territory. Overall sensitivity for emergency physicians, neurologists, and general radiologists for detecting the presence of infarction in scans rated as >1/3 MCA was 78%.CONCLUSIONS: Neuroradiologists can achieve moderate agreement in detecting >1/3 MCA infarction. The emergency physicians, neurologists, and general radiologists tested were reasonably skilled at detecting >1/3 MCA acute infarction. However, their performance did not reliably identify all patients who have early CT infarct signs that place them at increased risk for cerebral hemorrhage after thrombolytic therapy.",

The one that was chosen asked patients to write down questions and hand these to the doctor at the beginning of the consultation. Question sheets were given to all patients attending one clinic over a 13 week period.STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: Use of sheets: number of patients taking or refusing a sheet, with reasons for refusal, were recorded. Doctors noted those who handed questions sheets to them Satisfaction with sheets: patients completed a short feedback form after the consultation Effect on consultations: evaluated through interviews with the doctors.EFFECTS OF CHANGE: In total, 66 (41%) of the 162 patients offered the sheet declined: 14 had already prepared questions; eight being seen for the first time felt they did not know what to ask. Seventeen had used the sheet on a previous visit and did not need it again; 19 gave no reason; the rest said they had no questions. Seventy six (47%) patients produced a sheet in the consultation. Of those using the sheet, 64 (84%) liked it and 61 (80%) found it useful. Fifty two (68%) wished to use it at future consultations. The doctors reported that through questions articulated on the sheets many issues, fears, and misunderstandings emerged which otherwise would not have been identified. Concerns about increasing consultation time and clinical disruption did not materialize. In contrast, doctors reported patients to be taking more initiative and control, particularly on subsequent visits. None of these changes was noted in the comparison clinic.LESSONS LEARNT: An attractive, clear question sheet proved a simple but effective intervention in the consultation. Parents felt empowered to take control. The approach may have wider applicability, but implementation requires staff training and support to ensure its continuing use; this ensures medical staff adjust to a new consultation format, and that clinic nurses see the value of the sheets and continue to provide them.",

Jocicoeur, Nef harbors a makor determinant of pathogenicity for an AIDS-like disease induced by HIV-1 in transgenic mice. Cell 95 (1998) 163-175]. Nef expression has been detected in HIV infected human brains with neuronal damage [A. Ranki, M. Nyberg, V. Ovod, M. Haltia, I. Elovaara, R. Raininko, H. Haapsalo, K. Krohn, Abundant expression of HIV Nef and Rev proteins in brain astrocytes in associated with dementia, AIDS 9(9) (1995) 1001-1008; Y. Saito, L.R. Sharer, M.G. Epstein, J. Michaels, M. Mintz, M. Londer, K. Golding, B.M. Blumberg, Overexpression of nef as a marker for restricted HIV-1 infection of astrocytes in postmorten paediatric central tissues, Neurology 14 (1994) 474-480]. It is postulated that nef may contribute to the neuronal damage observed in the brain of those with late HIV disease. To test this, the potential toxicity of recombinant nef (from HIV-1 IIIB) was compared to the neurotoxin human tumour necrosis alpha (TNFalpha) on human brain cells in culture. SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, primary human neurons and glial cells were exposed to recombinant nef or TNFalpha protein for 3 days or twice over 6 days. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan Blue, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and MTT assays. Nuclear fragmentation was detected using the Hoechst Blue nuclear dye assay. Both nef and TNFalpha (100 ng/ml) caused a significant 30% reduction of SK-N-SH cell numbers after 3 days exposure (P=0. 001). At this time, exposure to nef caused evident fragmented nuclei in these cultures. Human neuronal cultures had a 32 and 33% decrease in cell number after 6 days exposure to either nef or TNFalpha, respectively (P<0.001). Furthermore, as previously shown [J. He, C.M. DeCastro, G.R. Vandenbark, J. Busciglio, D. Gabuzda, Astrocyte apoptosis induced by HIV-1 transactivation of the c-kit protoonocogene, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 94 (1997) 3954-3959], a 3-day exposure to nef significantly reduced human glial cell number by 25% (P=0.001). Recombinant nef and TNFalpha compromise human neurons in culture. Thus, like other virotoxins, it is shown for the first time that nef may also contribute to neuronal damage that has been reported in dementia in late HIV disease.",

By using parametric and categorical statistical methods, we studied characteristics in examined patients compared with others.RESULTS: Of a total of 912 patients, 431 (47%) had been examined neurologically. Among the women, 267 women (51%) had been examined; among the 164 men (43%). Patients with musculoskeletal disorders were more often examined, p = 0.0001, while those with faint or seizure disorders were significantly less frequently examined compared with other patients, p = 0.009. Clinical neurological examinations were performed more often in women compared with men, p = 0.03. The mean age was higher in the examined group (49.7 years) compared with others (46.5 years), p = 0.006.INTERPRETATION: Clinical neurological examination in patients referred to a neurological department had more often been performed in women, in higher age groups, and in those with musculoskeletal symptoms. In more than half of the patients, the decision of referring patients to the department of neurology was not based on results obtained from clinical neurological examination.",

The duration of preoperative symptoms was less than one year in 46.2%. The vertebral level most often involved was C5-C6 (97.4%). In 51.3% three levels were affected: 100% of the patients had stenosis in the zone of maximum compression; 28.2% had congenital stenosis of the canal and 66.7% had partial block shown on myelography or magnetic resonance studies of the cervical spine. There was clinical improvement in 78.4% after one month, in 91.9% after 3 months and in 94.6% after 6 months; only 2 patients had not improved on completion of the study. Motor and sensory function of the legs improved more than motor function of the arms and sphincter.CONCLUSIONS: The variables which influenced the degree of improvement were: age, duration of the symptoms, number of vertebral levels affected, presence of blockage and functional state. After application of the multiple regression model, it was seen that the duration of preoperative symptoms is an important predictor of the postoperative clinical course.",

However, protection of the auditory system and the prevention of sequelae is still paramount in neonatal neurology. The aim of this study was to compare auditory-evoked responses with a toy test and acoustic reflex in the early detection of hearing loss in infants.METHODS: Three groups were studied. The first was composed of infants showing less than a 30 dB biaural threshold in the neurophysiological test. The second group was made up of infants showing peripheral alterations on one side or both ears. The third group was comprised of infants who showed no responses at 95 dB HL in both ears after neurophysiological testing. The neurophysiological test, toy test, and acoustic reflex were performed on the same day, with masked results given to each investigator. Sensitivity and specificity for each toy test and acoustic reflex were calculated afterward.RESULTS: Forty-five controls, 44 peripheral alterations, and 8 non-response infants were studied. Most patients studied were born prior to the 37(th) week of gestation with a birthweight of less than 2,250 g, received required administration of potential ototoxic drugs and mechanical ventilation, and showed hyperbilirubinemia and hypoxia. Sensitivity for each toy was as follows: drum 0.54; wooden rattle 1.0, and metallic ratle 0.88. Specificity was 0.95, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively. Acoustic reflex sensitivity was 0.38 and specificity was 0.97.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the wooden and the metallic rattles of the toy test can be useful tools in the study of hearing in the high-risk infant and deserve more attention in future studies.",

The goal of this study was to establish the feasibility and efficacy of a neurosurgical curriculum designed to teach future primary care physicians about these diseases.METHODS: A compact, seven-lecture curriculum was developed to teach 3rd-year medical students about degenerative spine disease, stroke, tumor- and hydrocephalus-related raised intracranial pressure, head and spine injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. This curriculum was given as part of a 6-week pilot course that included neurology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, and rehabilitation medicine components. This course was administered to two groups of 18 medical students, and an examination was administered at the end of the pilot course. The same examination was administered to an additional 19 students immediately after their completion of the neurology course currently required. Students enrolled in the pilot neuroscience course performed significantly better (p<0.001) on the examination than those who had completed the standard neurology course. Striking improvements were noted in the recognition and management of head injury, hydrocephalus, and radiculopathy.CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of a short neurosurgery-related curriculum in a combined neuroscience course significantly improved student performance on an examination focusing on the recognition and management of common neurosurgical disorders. Because primary care physicians are responsible for the initial recognition and management of these disorders, the knowledge gained may lead to improved patient care.",

An epidemiological survey was conducted to identify risk factors for infection by ESBL Kp in this setting. The 38 isolates were distributed into 13 antibiotypes, three of which predominated (13, six and six isolates). The DNA macrorestriction pattern identified 15 genotypes, four of which predominated (11, six, four and four isolates). A combination of the two typing methods revealed several epidemic clones that emerged consecutively. Two main types of ESBL (SHV-2 and CTX-1) were identified by isoelectric focusing, the former predominating. The case-control study showed that the length of hospital stay, degree of malnutrition and dependency, and urinary sphincter status were the main factors significantly associated with ESBL Kp isolation.",

Most reports in cancer patients were before the use of MRI and MRV, which has simplified the diagnosis of CST.METHODS: The neurology database at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was used to identify cancer patients with a diagnosis of CST between January 1994 and April 1998.RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified. Nine had hematologic malignancies (HMs) and 11 had solid tumors (STs). The median interval from cancer diagnosis to presentation was 4 months for HMs and 20 months for STs. The most common symptom was headache. MRI and MRV correlated in all but three patients, and MRV was more sensitive in four patients. The most frequently involved cerebral sinus was the superior sagittal sinus. Multiple sinuses were affected in 8 of 19 patients. Five patients had a cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage and three had infarction. Disorders of coagulation were the most frequent etiology in patients with HM; compression or invasion of the cerebral sinus from dural/calvarial metastasis was the main cause in those with ST. Treatment was directed at the underlying cause. Ten of 20 patients improved clinically and 3 of 6 patients improved radiologically.CONCLUSION: MRI and MRV can diagnose CST accurately in cancer patients. Causes of CST depend on cancer type, and treatment varies with etiology. Most patients have a good outcome.",

Neurophysiological investigations were performed on the sural and peroneal nerve for detection of axonal and myelin lesion.RESULTS: Clinical examination proved progressive clinical signs and symptoms indicating distal symmetric polyneuropathy from CDC 1 (32%) to CDC 3 (55%). At least one neurophysiological result was impaired in CDC 1 in 25% and in CDC 3 in 45%. Significant correlation between neurophysiological changes and CDC4(+)-cells and beta-microglobuline were detected for stage CDC 3 C.CONCLUSION: Results show stage related prevalence of distal symmetric polyneuropathy already in early stages. In late stages of HIV-infection prevalence of distal symmetric polyneuropathy seems to be directly correlated to immunodeficiency syndrome. The pathogenesis of distal symmetric polyneuropathy during HIV-infection is up to now incompletely understood, but results indicate a clear dependency between progressive immunological dysfunction and neuropathy. High active antiretroviral therapy in patients suffering from distal symmetric polyneuropathy is a main topic of future studies.",

The aim of this prospective 4-year study was to evaluate the rising incidence of HIV-related admissions due to meningitis at the Pretoria Academic Hospital (PAH) adult neurology ward and to investigate the spectrum of meningitis during this time.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with meningitis presenting at the PAH neurology ward from March 1994 through February 1998 were included. HIV antibody status was determined and patients were assigned to five categories: bacterial, tuberculous, viral and cryptococcal meningitis, as well as an uncertain category.RESULTS: Over the 4-year study period 141 patients with meningitis were seen. Of these, 44 were HIV-positive (31%), with TB meningitis occurring in 16 (36%), cryptococcal meningitis in 22 (50%) and acute bacterial meningitis in three (7%). In the first 2 years of the study, 14% of patients were HIV positive; this figure rose to 44% in the 3rd year, and 57% in the final year. The spectrum of meningitis also changed: bacterial meningitis remained relatively stable at about 25% of the total; TB meningitis almost doubled from 16% in the 1st year to 31% in the last year of the study; viral meningitis initially occurred in 8% of patients and later in 3% of cases, while cryptococcal meningitis showed the most significant increase from 6% of cases in 1994/5 to 31 and 26% respectively in the last 2 years of the study.CONCLUSION: Over a 4-year period the HIV epidemic was responsible for a marked shift in the spectrum of meningitis towards chronic infections such as TB and cryptococcal meningitis at the PAH.",

The computed tomographic (CT) scans of 20 long-term users of benzodiazepine (65% men; mean age +/- SD [range], 42 +/- 12.1 years [23-59]; mean daily benzodiazepine dose [diazepam equivalents], 19.5 +/- 16.2 mg [2.5-70]; mean cumulative benzodiazepine exposure, 55.2 g [1.8-198]) were compared with 36 age- (+/-3 years) and sex-matched controls. Controls were prospectively recruited from 96 patients attending a neurology clinic and were interviewed to screen for alcohol and substance use disorders and other conditions possibly leading to brain atrophy. Three neuroradiologists blindly assessed each CT scan for atrophy and measured ventricles (V1, V2, V3), sulci, fissures, cisterns, and folia. Reliability among observers ranged from 0.92 to <0.1, in which case deleting one observer increased all reliabilities to >0.45. No difference in atrophy was found between benzodiazepine users and controls. V1 measures were significantly higher for benzodiazepine users than for controls (mean +/- SD, 12.1 +/- 1.3 vs. 11.1 +/- 2.0;p = 0.02), but measures of third and fourth largest sulci were significantly higher in controls than in benzodiazepine users. Right third and fourth largest sulci (mean +/- SD), respectively, were the following: controls, 0.72 +/- 0.4 and 0.74 +/- 0.7; benzodiazepine users, 0.51 +/- 0.3 and 0.46 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.02). Left third and fourth largest sulci, respectively, were the following: controls, 0.77 +/- 0.6 and 0.65 +/-0.3; benzodiazepine users, 0.53 +/- 0.3 and 0.5 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.02).

The subjects were 300 newly referred consecutive outpatients who were assessed for DSM IV anxiety and depressive disorders (PRIME-MD, and HAD), health status, and disability (SF-36), and patients', GPs' and neurologists' ratings of the need for patient to receive psychiatric or psychological treatment.RESULTS: Of 300 new patients, 140 (47%) met criteria for one or more DSM IV anxiety or depressive diagnosis. Major depression was the most common (27%). A comparison of patients with and without emotional disorder showed that physical function, physical role functioning, bodily pain, and social functioning were worse in patients with emotional disorders (p<0. 0005). The median number of somatic symptoms was greater in patients with emotional disorders (p<0.0005). These differences were independent of the presence of neurological disease. Few patients wished to receive psychiatric or psychological treatments. Both general practitioners and neurologists were more likely to recommend psychiatric treatment when the patients' symptoms were medically unexplained.CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of new referrals to general neurology clinics met criteria for a DSM IV psychiatric diagnosis. These patients were more disabled, and had more somatic symptoms. They expressed little enthusiasm for receiving psychiatric treatment.",
